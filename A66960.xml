            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And theſe things from our Saviours Commiſſion they are obliged to perform, and conſequently to uſe ſuch Aſſemblies and Meetings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Conſults, Summons, Examinations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Without which ſuch things cannot be performed, tho' any Civil or Secular power, Heathen, or Chriſtian (who perhaps may be an Heretick or Schiſmatick; as ſome Chriſtian Princes have been Arians) doth oppoſe them. [So, a Chriſtian Emperor <hi>Conſtantius</hi> being an Arian, and prohibiting in his Empire the promulgation of the Orthodox Doctrine of the Trinity, yet the Weſtern Catholick Biſhops, nevertheleſs, did promulgate their definition of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation of the Son with the Father.] And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of theſe two Secular Powers the Chriſtian, if either, ſeems to have the leſs capacity to hinder or reſiſt them: becauſe he profeſſeth himſelf, with the reſt of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as to the knowing of Spiritual Truths, a Subject,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48657:6"/>and a Scholar of the Church; and becauſe he ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claimeth a Supreme Power, and profeſſeth an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from God over all perſons, in all Spiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to bind them, upon Temporal puniſhments, to the obedience of the Church's (or Clergy's) Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Decrees. But if he meaneth here, only where himſelf firſt judgeth ſuch their Decrees orthodox and right, this power is, (in effect,) claimed, to bind all perſons, in all Spiritual matters, only to his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; whilſt he pretends an Obligation both of himſelf and of his Subjects to the Churches. Yet ſo it is indeed, that all Princes whatever, even the Heathen, have ſuch an Obligation from God: Nor doth any Text of the New Teſtament give Chriſtian Princes more Authority over the Church, to reſtrain any Liberties thereof, than it giveth to the Heathen Princes. For all the Texts, which are urged thence, ordain obedience of Church men to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Princes that then Reigned, no leſs, than to others. And all Princes are obliged, with the Sword, which God hath given them, not only not to perſecute, but to protect and defend, his true Religion and Service in their Dominions, whenſoever it offereth it ſelf to them, and claimeth their Subjection and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1, 2, 10, 11,
12. Tho the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Princes to this may be more than that of others, as he hath had more divine Truth revealed, and hath received more favors from God and his Church.

<hi>Nicene</hi> Decrees) prove, that they were not of force without ſuch conſent: nor doth the Councills intreating the Emperors conſent, when Chriſtian, prove; they did this, to legitimate the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48657:7"/>making or enjoyning of ſuch laws (for ſuch laws they had formerly both made, and impoſed, when Emperors were their enemies) but to ſtrengthen the obſervance of them. Indeed the Prince, who beareth the Secular Sword, his giving to the Miniſters of Chriſt his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, to exerciſe their office, and their eccleſiaſtical cenſures in his dominions, or in any part or province thereof, as it implies the prohibiting of his officers or ſubjects any way to diſturb them, is to great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and therefore much to be deſired; But it ſheweth not, that it is in his juſt power to deny them ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. (I mean in general; for I meddle not here with the Princes denying ſome of them to do theſe things, whilſt he admits others); or that his officers or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, without it, may lawfully diſturb them in any part of their Spiritual Function.

So he ſaith, p. 42. That external juriſdiction is either definitive or mulctative. Authority
<hi>definitive</hi> in matters of Faith and Religion belonged to the Church: <hi>Mulctative</hi> power is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, either as it is with coaction, or as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Spiritual cenſures. As it ſtandeth in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cenſures, it is the right of the Church, and was practiced by the Church, when without Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and ſince. But <hi>coactive</hi> Juriſdiction was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48657:7"/>ways underſtood to belong to the Civil Magiſtrate, whether Chriſtian, or Heathen.</q>
                        <q>And by this power (ſaith he, c. 4 p. 39.) without coaction, the Church was called, Faith was planted, Devils were ſubdued, the Nations were taken out of the power of darkneſs, the World reduced to the obedience of Chriſt; by this power, without coactive Juriſdiction, the Church was governed for Three Hundred years together.</q> [But, if it be inquired what was done, when the Emperors were Chriſtian, and when their coactive power came in?]
<q>The Emperors (ſaith he, p. 178.) never took upon them by their authority to define matters of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that they left to the Church. But when the Church had defined ſuch truths againſt Hereticks, and had depoſed ſuch Hereticks; then the Emperors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the Church by their Imperial Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did, by their coactive power, give ſtrength to the Canons of the Church.</q> But then: what if the Emperors, being Chriſtian, ſhould take upon them, by their authority, to define matters of Faith, or ſhould uſe their coactive power againſt the Canons of the Church?

                        <q>The power of the Church is ſo abſolute (ſaith he) and depending on God alone, that if a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign profeſſing Chriſtianity ſhould forbid, the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Faith, or the exerciſe of thoſe Ordinances, which God hath required to be ſerved with, or even the exerciſe of that Eccleſiaſtical power which ſhall be neceſſary to preſerve the Unity of the Church; it muſt needs be neceſſary, for thoſe that are truſted with the power of the Church not only to diſobey the Commands of the Sovereign, but to uſe that power, which their quality in the Society of the Church gives them, to provide for the ſubſiſtence thereof without the aſſiſtance of Secular powers. A thing manifeſtly ſuppoſed by all the Biſhops of the ancient Church in all thoſe actions; wherein they refuſed, to obey their Emperors ſeduced by Hereticks, and to ſuffer their Churches to be <hi>regulated</hi> by them, to the prejudice of

<hi>Right of the Church,</hi> 4. chap. And like things he ſaith in his <hi>Epilog. of the Church of Engl.</hi> See there 1. l. 9. c. the Contents whereof touching this Subject he hath briefly expreſſed thus:
<q>That that power, which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Sovereign. That the Intereſt of Secular power in determining matters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the Act of it. That the Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity thro Chriſtendome, as the Sovereign is of civil Peace thro his Dominions.</q> And there he giveth reaſons why the Church is to decide matters of Faith, rather than the State, ſuppoſing neither to be infallible. And ſee 1. l. 20. c. p. 158. Where he ſaith, That He, who diſturbs the Communion of the Church, remains puniſhable by the Secular power (to inflict Temporal Penalties) not abſolutely, becauſe it is Chriſtian; but upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that this Temporal power maintaineth the true Church. And afterward,
<q>That the Secular power is not able of it ſelf to do any of thoſe Acts, which the Church (<hi>i. e,</hi> thoſe who are qualified by and for the Church) are qualified by vertue of their Commiſſion from Chriſt to do, without committing the Sin of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge (in ſeizing into its own hands the powers, which by Gods Act are conſtituted; and therefore conſecrated and dedicated to his own Service) not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48657:8"/>ſuppoſing the free Act of the Church, without fraud and violence, to the doing of it; [<hi>i. e.</hi> joyned to the Secular power, doing ſuch Act.]</q> Now amongſt the Acts and Powers belonging to the Church (which he calls a Corporation) by divine right and appointment he names theſe l. 1. c. 16. p. 116.
<q>The power of making Laws within themſelves; of Electing Church Governors (of which ſee 3. l.
32. c. p. 398,) and of excommunicating, and (3. l. 32. c. p 385,) the power to determine all matters, the determination whereof is requiſite to maintain the communion of Chriſtians in the Service of God; and [the power] to oblige Chriſtians to ſtand to that determination under pain of forfeiting that Communion; the power of holding Aſſemblies, of which he ſpeaketh thus 1. l. 8. c. p. 54. I that pretend the Church to be a Corporation Founded by God upon a Priviledge of holding <hi>viſible Aſſemblies</hi> for the common Service of God, notwithſtanding any Secular force prohibiting the ſame, muſt needs main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by conſequence, that the Church hath power in it ſelf to hold all ſuch Aſſemblies as ſhall be requiſite to maintain the common Service of God and the Unity in it, and the order of all Aſſemblies that exerciſe it.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Thorndike.</hi>

                        </note> And thus Dr <hi>Fern</hi> of the power of Judicature belonging to the Clergy.
<q>It is confeſſed (ſaith he) on both ſides, that the power of <hi>Ordination</hi> and of
<hi>Judicature,</hi> ſo far as the Keys left by Chriſt in his Church do extend, is of divine Inſtitution; and that this power muſt be exerciſed or adminiſtred in the Church by ſome
[either Biſhops or Presbyters] is alſo confeſſed to be of divine right Therefore, ſurely, no Secular Prince can juſtly prohibit within his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the exerciſe of ſuch
<hi>Judicature;</hi> nor, prohibiting is to be obeyed; and Chriſt's ſubſtitutes, herein being denyed the aſſiſtance of the Civil power, are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without it.</q> To theſe I will add what Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> hath delivered on the ſame Subject in <hi>Epiſcopacy aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and this the rather, becauſe this Treatiſe was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Command of ſo underſtanding a Prince. He,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48657:9"/>after that, p. 263. he hath laid this ground for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Secular Princes;
<q>That, ſince that Chriſt hath profeſſed, that his Kingdom is not of this world, that Government, which he hath conſtituted <hi>de novo,</hi> doth no way make any intrenchment on the Royalty; hath theſe paſſages. P. 237. he ſaith, That thoſe things which Chriſtianity (as it preſcinds from the intereſt of the Republick) hath introduced, all them and all the cauſes emergent from them the Biſhop is Judge of. Such are cauſes of Faith; Miniſtration of Sacraments; and Sacramentals; <hi>Subordinations of inferiour Clergy to their ſuperiour;</hi> Rites, Liturgies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for the rights of the Secular power, he layeth down this Rule, p. 236 Whatſoever the Secular Tribunal did take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of before it was Chriſtian, the ſame it takes notice of after it is Chriſtened. And theſe are: All actions civil, all publick violations of Juſtice, all breach of Municipal laws. Theſe the Church (ſaith he) hath nothing to do with, unleſs by the favour of Princes theſe be indulged to it [theſe by their favour then indulged, but not ſo the former.]. Accordingly p. 239. he ſaith: Both
<hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> have indicted Synods in ſeveral ages upon the exigence of ſeveral occaſions, and have ſeveral powers for the engagement of clerical obedience and attendance upon ſuch Solemnities. That the Biſhops juriſdiction hath a Compulſory, derived from Chriſt only, <hi>viz.</hi> Infliction of Cenſures by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or other
<hi>minores plagae,</hi> which are in order to it. And that the King is ſupreme of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that part of it, which is the external compulſory [<hi>i. e,</hi> as he ſaith before] to ſuperadd a temporal Penalty upon contumacy, or ſome other way abett the cenſures of the Church. P. 243. he ſaith, That in thoſe caſes, in which by the law of Chriſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops may, or in which they muſt, uſe Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no power can forbid them. For what power Chriſt hath given them, no man can take away. And p. 144. That the Church may inflict her cenſures upon her delinquent children without asking leave; that Chriſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48657:9"/>is her <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> for that; he is her warrant and ſecurity. And p.
245. That the Kings ſupreme regal power in cauſes of the Church conſiſts in all things, in which the Prieſtly office is not preciſely, by Gods law, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for regiment and cure of Souls: [<hi>I ſuppoſe thoſe he named before p.</hi> 237.] and in theſe alſo, that all the external Compulſory and Juriſdiction [<hi>as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it before p.</hi> 239] is the Kings.</q> And laſtly,
<q>p. 241. he ſaith, that the Catholick Biſhops <hi>[in time of the Arian Emperors]</hi> made humble and fair remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the diſtinction of Powers and Juriſdiction; that as they might not intrench upon the Royalty, ſo neither betray the right which Chriſt concredited to them to the encroachment of an exteriour Juriſdiction and Power, [i. e, <hi>the Royal.</hi>] See the like expreſſions frequent in Biſhop <hi>Bramhal, Schiſm Guarded,</hi> p. 61. All which our Kings (ſaith he) aſſume to themſelves, is the external regiment of the Church by coactive power to be exerciſed by perſons capable of the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective branches of it</q> [i. e, <hi>of that regiment;</hi>] and p. 63, He comments thus on the 37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
                        <q>You ſee the Power is political, the Sword is political, all is political. Our Kings leave the power of the Keys and Juriſdiction purely Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to thoſe to whom Chriſt hath left it.</q> And p. 92, he ſaith,
<q>We ſee the primitive Fathers did aſſemble Synods and make Canons before there were any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperors; but they had no coactive power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel any man againſt his will
<hi>[this therefore is the power which Christian Princes bring in to them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking away, I hope, any of that power which the Church from Chriſt held under Heathen Princes.]</hi>
                        </q>And p.
119,
<q>We acknowledge, that Biſhops were always eſteemed the proper Judges of the Canons, both for compoſing of them, and executing of them; but with this caution, that to make them laws <hi>[he means ſuch Laws, for obſervance of which Secular coaction might be uſed,]</hi> the Confirmation of the Prince was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to give the Biſhop a coactive power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48657:10"/>them, the Princes grant or conceſſion was needful.</q> [<hi>Doth not this Biſhop mean here, that Biſhops may both compoſe and execute Canons in the Kings domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and uſe the Eccleſiaſtical cenſures by their own authority; only that they can uſe no</hi> coaction <hi>by pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary or corporal puniſhments in the execution of them, without his? But ſee below<hi>§. 22.</hi> The Biſhops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the former power in the Reformation: See more of this</hi> §. 35. <hi>N.</hi> 2.] And Anſwer to <hi>Chalc.</hi> p. 161. he ſaith,
<q>It is coercive and compulſory and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robatory Power, it is the application of the matter, it is the regulating of the exerciſe of actual Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juriſdiction in the
<hi>[external]</hi> Court of the Church; <hi>[Why or under what pretence?]</hi> to prevent (ſaith he) the oppreſſion of their Subjects, and to provide for the tranquility of the Common wealth,
<hi>[not therefore to examine, what in thoſe external Courts of the Church is paſſed agreeable or diſagreeable to Gods word; for this Princes are to learn from thoſe Courts]</hi> which belongs to Sovereign Princes.</q> Thus he Laſtly ſee the Kings laſt Paper in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> p 3. where it is ſaid.
<q>That tho the Biſhops in the times under Pagan Princes had no outward coercive power over mens perſons or eſtates <hi>[no more have they now except from and during the Princes pleaſure:]</hi> Yet inaſmuch as every Chriſtian man, when he became a member of the Church, did, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> and by that his own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Act, put himſelf under their Government
<hi>[ſo Christian men do ſtill, Princes and all]</hi> they exerciſed a very large power of Juriſdiction in <hi>Spiritualibus;</hi> in making Eccleſiaſtical Canons, in receiving Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conventing the accuſed, examining witneſſes, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of crimes
<hi>[againſt Gods law]</hi> excluding ſuch men, as they found guilty of ſcandalous offences, from the Lords Supper, enjoyning Penancies upon them, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of the Church, receiving them again upon their Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> [Now I ſubſume, the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Eccleſiaſtical Canons, the ſame Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, caſting out of the Church or Excommunication,

When ever the Chriſtian Prince or State is to them as a Heathen, in his withdrawing and prohibiting theſe neceſſary things, then may they behave themſelves as formerly in Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, <hi>i. e,</hi> do theſe things without their leave, againſt their prohibitions. All the Plea, that a Secular State ſubjecting it ſelf to the Church can make for medling in ſuch Spiritual affairs, ſeems to be this; that the Church ſhall not be troubled (now as formerly) to do all, becauſe the State with its more awing power will do ſomething for it. Which is, the aſſiſting of the Church in her buſineſs, not the abridging of her in her power.]</p>

<q>Seeing the Church (ſaith he) ſubſiſted Three Hundred years, before any State profeſſed Chriſtianity, whatſoever right it uſed during that time, manifeſtly therefore it ought ſtill to uſe and enjoy: this being the moſt pertinent evidence to ſhew the bounds of it <hi>[(i. e.) of ſuch rights independent on any Temporal Governor]</hi> See him 4. c. p.

And if he put ſuch to death for diſobeying this his Command, when as it is contrary to Gods, and Chriſts, who ſendeth them to all Nations, in effect he puts them to death for obeying Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and they dye <hi>Martyrs.</hi> As alſo the Primitive Martyrs were put to death for not obeying the Emperors Laws concerning matters of their Religion.</p>

For if Temporal Governors could at their pleaſure, or, as they thought meet, place and diſplace the Clergy, tho they cannot ſtate all Divine matters by themſelves, yet may they make the Church's Synods (which is all one)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48657:13"/>to ſtate them according to their minds, either by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſome <hi>de novo</hi> who are for them; (as Princes can never want thoſe who conform to, or at leaſt comply with, their judgment;) or by removing ſome who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them; and ſo making, the formerly leſſer, then, a major part in ſuch Aſſemblies.

<hi>after another manner than his Predeceſſors had exerciſed it formerly.</hi> Becauſe ſome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, namely this; of aſſembling a Synod of the Clergy, upon Temporal puniſhments in caſe of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by their Writs (the ancient form of which ſee in Dr.
<hi>Heylin,</hi> p. 4) when any urgent occaſions required: as likewiſe of enjoyning to all their Subjects, as well Clergy, as others, upon Temporal Penalties, the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Decrees and Conſtitutions of ſuch Synods, or of any other former lawful Councils (ſuch as the Clergy ſhall acknowledge to have been the Decrees there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) theſe Supremacies (I ſay) the Princes of this Land before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, had and exerciſed; neither was any ſuch Supremacy uſurped, or interrupted, by the Pope. Neither do the Roman Doctors deny ſuch an external coactive Juriſdiction of Princes in Spiritual Affairs; 1. as to bind their Clergy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> upon Temporal Mulcts, to meet together in Council, when the ſame Princes ſhall think it neceſſary; the Eccleſiaſticks being their Subjects, as well as Chriſts Clergy, and on this account bound to obey them, as well as their Spiritual Governors on the other; and there being often good cauſe of their aſſembling in order to the peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the civil State committed to the <hi>Princes</hi> care, becauſe this dependeth much on the right Government of the Church committed to <hi>theirs.</hi> Provided only, that theſe Aſſemblies be ſo timed and diſpoſed by the

The whole Debate with all the traverſes and emergent difficulties which appeared herein (ſaith Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>) are ſpecified at large in the Records of Convocation 1532, which were well
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48657:19"/>worthy the viewing. Now, if the Firſt and Second <hi>Theſis</hi> above-named ſtand good, this Act of the Clergy is utterly unlawful.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48657:20"/>annul. This appears, both by the practice of their abrogating and reforming of ſeveral Canons, that were ſuch; (nay I think ſuch were all that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:) and alſo by the Tenent, (See below §. 28. Statute 25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.21. c.) that all the

<q>How can the Pope (ſaith he) pretend to any Coactive power in <hi>England,</hi> where the Power of the Militia and all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active force is legally inveſted in the King? And p. 92.

51.)
<q>By the laſt Branch thereof it is plain, that the intent of the Contrivers was by degrees to weaken the Authority of the Epiſcopal Order by forcing them from their hold of Divine Inſtitution, and making them no other than the Kings Miniſters only, his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Sheriffs to execute his Mandates. And of this Act ſuch uſe was made (tho poſſibly beyond the true intention of it) that the Biſhops of thoſe times were not in a capacity of conferring Orders, but as they were thereunto impowered by eſpecial Licence.</q> [<hi>Where he quoteth out of</hi> Sanders <hi>what is ſet down below</hi> §. 145.]
<q>Which (ſaith he) being looked on by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> not only as a dangerous diminution of the Epiſcopal Power, but as an odious innovation in the Church of Chriſt: She cauſed this Act to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, leaving the Biſhops to depend on their former [i. e, <hi>Divine</hi>] Inſtitution; and to act in all things, which belonged to their Juriſdiction, in their own Names and under their own Seals, as in former times. In which Eſtate they have continued, without any legal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, from that time to this. Thus He.</q> Now to go on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Conſequently we find (in 2. <hi>Edw:</hi> 6.1. c.) the King and Parliament authorizing Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48657:31"/>by vertue of their Act, <hi>to</hi> take Informations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>not uſing</hi> of the Form of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> &amp;c therein preſcribed; and to puniſh the ſame <hi>by Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> &amp;c.</q> And in Stat. 5, 6. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.1. c. it is Enacted likewiſe concerning the ſame Common-Prayer Book Eſtabliſhed by Parliament.
<q>That all Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops <hi>&amp;c</hi> ſhall have full power and authority <hi>by this Act</hi> to correct and puniſh <hi>by Cenſures of the Church</hi> all perſons, who ſhall offend againſt this Act and Statute.</q> Which Clauſe, <hi>by vertue of this Act,</hi> and the like, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that the Biſhops might not excommunicate and uſe the Church Cenſures for that matter without the King and Parliament's Licence; or ought to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in all matters, wherein the King and Parliament command it. Whereby we may underſtand more clearly the meaning of that Act (forementioned p. 44. §. 26.) 26. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.1. c. and that 1.
<hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. c. That the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Juriſdiction, there aſcribed to the King or Queen, involves the <hi>Juriſdiction of Excommunication,</hi> as well as others; not for the King to exerciſe this himſelf, but to appoint when and in what matters the Clergy within his Realm ſhall execute, or not execute, it: ſo that they derive the power of exerciſing of this Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his Dominions alſo from the King; contrary to the Second and Third <hi>Theſis.</hi> And indeed if the Clergy may not make nor enjoyn any new or old Spiritual Laws, may not correct what they judge Hereſies, Errors, Vices, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> without the Kings conſent had thereto (See the Acts ſet down before §. 31, 32, 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) it is but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they ſhould not excommunicate his Subjects without his conſent, for not obeying ſuch Laws, or for being thought guilty of ſuch Crimes. And this is the reaſon, I ſuppoſe, of Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> Obſervation (<hi>Hiſt. of Reform.</hi> p. 94.)
<q>That in thoſe times the Wings of Epiſcopal Authority were ſo clipped, that it was ſcarce able to fly abroad; the Sentence of Excommunication, wherewith the Biſhops formerly kept in awe both Prieſt and People, not having been in uſe and practice from the firſt of King
<hi>Edward:</hi>

<q>That his Majeſty as Supreme Head of the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath full Power and Authority to make and ſet forth Laws, Injunctions, and Ordinances concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Orders in the ſaid Church for repreſſing of all Errors and Hereſies, and other enormities and abuſes; ſo that the ſame alteration be not contrary or repugnant to the Scripture and Law of God (as is ſaid in the Sixth of the Second Articles ſent to this Biſhop.)</q> [<hi>Now how far this repreſſing and reforming of Errors,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>claimed by the King, did extend, we may ſee in thoſe points but now named.</hi>] In the <hi>Fifth:</hi>
                        <q>That all Subjects who diſobey any his ſaid Majeſties Laws, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, Ordinances
[<hi>in ſuch matters</hi>] already ſet forth and publiſhed, or hereafter to be ſet forth and publiſhed, ought worthily to be puniſhed according to his Eccleſiaſtical Law uſed within this his Realm.</q> Again; in the 7.11, 12.14.16. of the Third Articles
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48657:34"/>ſent to the ſame Biſhop:
<q>That the former Liturgies of the Church, Maſs-Books <hi>&amp;c,</hi> that the Canons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding Prieſts Marriage <hi>&amp;c,</hi> are juſtly taken away and aboliſh'd: and the new Forms of Common-Prayer, and of Conſecration of Biſhops and Prieſts are juſtly eſtabliſhed by Authority of Parliament, and by the Statutes and Laws of this Realm; and therefore ought to be received and approved of all the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Gods word.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where note; That tho, in ſome of theſe Articles,<note place="margin">§. 45. n. 2.</note> the Authority of Parliament is mentioned; yet in none of theſe is any thing ſaid of the conſent of the Clergy as neceſſary to make ſuch Regal or Parliamentary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions in Eccleſiaſtical matters valid. From which may be collected; That when the Synodal conſent of the Clergy is any where elſe mentioned, as ſometimes it is, (See the Letter of the King and Council to Biſhop <hi>Bonner, Fox</hi> p. 1186, and the Kings Meſſage to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of
<hi>Cornwal, Fox</hi> p. 1189:) it is not to add any Authority to thoſe Injunctions thereby; (which Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were impoſed on the Clergy before any Synodal conſent of the Clergy was either given or asked:) but to propoſe the judgment and example of the Clergy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, as a motive to render others, that ſtand out, conformable; as whoſe judgment they ought to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and whoſe example they ought to follow; not, as whoſe Decree and Conſtitution they ought to obey. And if you wonder, why the King and Parliament of thoſe days never pleaded this laſt (as you ſhall never find it pleaded by them); the reaſon (I conjecture) was (beſides that they were conſcious of ſome changes made by them of theſe Eccleſiaſtical Judges, diſplacing thoſe who would not conform to their Inclinations; which rendred them not ſo authentical) becauſe they ſaw, that the Laws of this National Clergy could ſtand in no force, by vertue of their Office or any Commiſſion from Chriſt; but that ſo would alſo the Laws of the Church and her Synods, which were Superior to the Engliſh Clergy, and which were contrary to the Laws
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48657:35"/>of this National Synod; and ſo would void and make them of none effect. And if the King by vertue of his Supremacy urged his, and his Subjects, freedome from the former Laws and Conſtitutions of the Church <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal;</hi> ſo muſt he, from the preſent Laws of his own Church <hi>National:</hi> He, and his Subjects, being tied in no more Duty to the one, than to the other; nor in ſo much.</p>

<hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, for the furthering of a Reformation, tho he could effect nothing therein. In which Synod the Clergy (now too late perceiving, that, not only the Pope, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, had loſt their former Eccleſiaſtical Power; and that the King and Parliament ordered Spiritual Affairs as they pleaſed, without their conſents) requeſted, that, at leaſt, the reſt of their Convocation might be joyned, with the Houſe of Commons; as the Biſhops were, with the Lords: that ſo they might have a Vote alſo in paſſing Church matters; but this requeſt would not be granted

Where, ſeeking too late to recover their former Steerage in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Affairs now tranſacted in the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Lower Houſe of Convocation prefers theſe Requeſts,
<q>That, Whereas in a Stat. 25. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the Clergy had promiſed in <hi>Verbo Sacerdotii</hi> never from thenceforth to Enact <hi>&amp;c</hi> any new <hi>Canons, Conſtitutions &amp;c</hi> unleſs the Kings Aſſent and Licence may to them be had <hi>&amp;c:</hi> therefore they deſire that the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Licence may be for them obtained, authorizing them to attempt and commune of ſuch matters, and therein freely to give their conſent; which otherwiſe they may not do, upon pain and peril premiſed.

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> That all Judges Eccleſiaſtical proceeding after thoſe Laws may be without danger and peril. That, whereas they were informed, that certain Prelates and other Learned Men were appointed to alter the Service in the Church <hi/> and did make certain Books

                        </q> Thus laboured then the poor Clergy to obtain a joint ſhare at leaſt with the Parliament and civil State, in tranſacting the Affairs of the Church. And Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> (in <hi>Reform. Juſtified</hi> §. 4. p. 21.) grants thus much,
<q>That the Cenſures of the Church were grown weak, if not invalid, and conſequently, by degrees, became neglected; ever after that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth took the

Fox</hi> p. 1602.
<q>You (ſaith he) refuſing the Determination of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, bring Scripture for the Probation of your Aſſertions; and we alſo bring Scriptures. You underſtand them in one ſenſe; we in another. How will you know the truth herein? If you ſtand to your

But if you ſay, you will follow the minds of the Doctors and Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſemblably you underſtand them in one mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and we take them in another. How will you know the truth herein? If you ſtand to your own judgment; then are you ſingular in your own conceit, and cannot avoid the <hi>Vae.</hi> It remaineth therefore, that you ſubmit your ſelf to the determination and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement of the Church; with whom God promiſed to remain to the world's end. <hi>Thus the other ſide argued with them.</hi>
                        </q> But meanwhile what averſion they had of ſubmitting to the judgment of the Church, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, ſee in the forecited Conference of Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> with <hi>Latimer.</hi> Where, having objected the Authority of General Councils for the Maſs, he anſwereth thus,
<q>That, whenſoever they, who rule and govern the Church, are the lively Members of Chriſt, and walk after the guiding and rule of his Word; Councils ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together of ſuch Guides do indeed repreſent the Univerſal Church; and have a promiſe of the guiding of his Spirit into all truth: But that any ſuch Council hath at any time allowed the Maſs <hi>&amp;c,</hi> I affirm (ſaith he) to be impoſſible; for Superſtition [i, e. <hi>the Maſy</hi>] and the ſincere Religion of Chriſt, can never agree together. For Determination of all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Chriſt's Religion, Chriſt hath left unto the Church not only <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, to ask coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel at; but alſo the Goſpels. Chriſt would have the Church his Spouſe in all doubts to ask counſel at the word of his Father written. Neither do we read, that Chriſt in any place hath laid ſo great a Burthen upon the Members of his Spouſe; that he hath commanded them to go to the Univerſal Church. It is true, that Chriſt gave unto his Church <hi>ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets &amp;c.</hi> But that all men ſhould meet together, out of all parts of the world, to define of the Articles of our Faith; I neither find it commanded of Chriſt, nor written in the Word of God.</q> To which Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48657:43"/>nexeth theſe words,
<q>In things pertaining to God and Faith, we muſt ſtand only to the Scriptures; which are able to make us all perfect and inſtructed to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they be well underſtood.

<hi>Mala Dogmata</hi> being by the Lower Houſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation at this time preſented to the Upper Houſe of Biſhops, to have them condemned, occaſioned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of theſe Injunctions. But yet notwithſtanding all this, for the manner of the Edition of theſe Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Articles, it is to be noted; that the King by vertue of his Supremacy commands them to be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Subjects, not as appearing to him the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances or Definitions of the Church, but as judged by him agreeable to the Laws and Ordinances of God: and makes the Clergy therein only his Counſellor and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer; not a Law-giver.

                        <q>To ſay truth; as long as the Clergy were in Power, and had Authority in Convocation to do what they would, in matters which concerned Religion; thoſe of the Parliament conceived it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſafe nor fitting, to intermeddle in ſuch buſineſs as concerned the Clergy; for ſear of being queſtioned for it at the Church's Barr</q>

<q>To many (ſaith he) who be yet alive, and can teſtify theſe things, it is not unknown; How variable, the State of Religion ſtood in theſe days; How hardly, and with what difficulty, it came forth; what chances and changes it ſuffered: even as the King was ruled and gave ear, ſometimes to one, ſometimes to another; ſo, one while it went forward, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seaſon as much backward again; and ſometime clean altered and changed for a Seaſon; according as they could prevail who were about the King. So long as Queen <hi>Anne</hi> lived, the Goſpel had indifferent Succeſs.</q> [<hi>Here</hi> (then) <hi>the Supream Head of the Church was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a Woman; and managed the Affairs of Religion accordingly.]</hi>
                        <q>After that ſhe, by ſiniſter Inſtigation of ſome about the King, was made away, the courſe of the Goſpel began again to decline; but that the Lord ſtirred op the Lord
<hi>Cromwel</hi> opportunely to help in that behalf; who did much avail for the increaſe of Gods true Religion <hi>[Here then the Supream Head of the Church was directed by a Laick; and managed Religion accordingly]</hi> and much more had he brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; if the peſtilent Adverſaries, maligning the proſperous Glory of the Goſpel, had not ſupplanted his vertuous Proceedings</q> [<hi>Mr.</hi> Fox <hi>names not</hi> Cranmer amongſt theſe Worthies; becauſe he was an Agent in many of thoſe Proceedings of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, which diſpleaſe
<hi>Mr.</hi> Fox.]
<q>After the taking away of which <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the State of Religion more and more decayed, during all the reſidue of the Reign of King <hi>Henry.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe Adverſaries was <hi>Stephen Gardiner;</hi> who brought the King at length clean out of credit with the Reformed Religion <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<hi>England;</hi> and to ſet at liberty all ſuch Religious Perſons, as deſired to be free; and all other that were under the Age of 24 Years: providing withal, that ſuch Monks, Canons, and Fryars, as were diſmiſſed, ſhould have given them by the Abbot or Prior, inſtead of their habit, a Secular Prieſts Gown, and Forty Shillings of Money; and likewiſe the Nunns to have ſuch Apparel, as Secular Women did then commonly uſe; and be ſuffered to go where they would.</q> [<hi>Cromwel</hi> ſaying, Lord <hi>Herb.</hi> pag. 462. <hi>That this Expulſion of the Monks</hi> &amp;c <hi>was no more than a reſtoring them to their first Inſtitution of being Lay and labouring Perſons; and that they might keep the auſterity of life, in their ſeveral Orders, enjoyned them, in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.]
<q>At which time alſo from the ſaid Abbies, and Monaſteries were taken their chief Jewels and Relicks.</q> And ſee the words of the Statute 31. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.13. c,

Whereupon, as ſome think, he was firſt invited to this Act, by thoſe 40 ſmaller Monaſteries, which he ſaw
<hi>Wolſey</hi> (who likewiſe had much uſed in this Affair his diligent Servant

The King knew alſo, that he had the Laity and the Parliament ready to ſecond him; who were willing by any means to remove the burthen of furniſhing the Kings neceſſities from themſelves, and to give up the Church's Patrimony to ſave their own: and beſides, who in thoſe days looked, with no good Eye, on the Authority of the Clergy (againſt whom the Commons had formerly put up a Supplication to the King) and the Wealth of the Monaſticks;<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Precedent of Cardinal
<hi>Wolſey;</hi> 1. <note place="margin">2.</note> There was nothing done in it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but what was juſtifiable by the Eccleſiaſtical Canons: it being lawful in ſome Caſes, and on ſome Conditions, for the Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors amongſt Church-men to alienate, or rather to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from one pious uſe to another, thoſe things which are given to them; or, being given to God, are in his right poſſeſſed by them, as his Miniſters. But hence will it riot follow; that any Lay, tho the Sovereign,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48657:59"/>Power, who is not the Receiver or Poſſeſſor of ſuch a Gift, but rather the Doner (for without the King's Conſent the Church receives no ſuch Gifts) can after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſume from God and the Church the diſpoſal of it. Here I may ſay as St.
<hi>Peter Acts</hi> 5. 4. Before it was ſo beſtowed by him, <hi>was it not his own?</hi> But once ſo paſſed away, and his <hi>Mort-main</hi> allowed to it; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then be recalled, upon any Secular Title. But Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Suppoſe the King Heir to all that Supremacy, which in theſe matters the Pope or other Eccleſiaſtical Perſons have formerly exerciſed; yet this Power will not extend to that which the King aſſumed. For the Pope pretends to no ſuch Power, as to alienate the Church Revenues, for to ſpend them himſelf; or to diſpoſe of them in what manner, or to what Perſons, he pleaſeth; but only for ſome juſt cauſe, <hi>i.e.</hi> in a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential arbitration, for an equal or greater Benefit thence accrewing to the Church, or Chriſtianity. Which alſo was obſerved in his conceſſion of thoſe to Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> in a time when <hi>Religious</hi> abounded, more than
<hi>Schollars;</hi> and by that Conceſſion the Church ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys them. But whither
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Abbey-lands went, and what uſes they have ſerved, we all know; and this ſome think, to the enriching of few, but ruine of many, Noble Families in this Nation. See Dr. <hi>Heylin's Hiſt. of Reform. of Qu. Mary</hi> p. 45. and p. 67, 68.</p>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither were the Vices of thoſe Religious a ſufficient ground of overthrowing their Societies and Foundations;<note place="margin">3.</note> becauſe the King might have puniſhed, ejected, changed, the Perſons, without taking away the Houſes or Maintenance (as is frequently done in all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties; and, particularly, in Religious Houſes abroad) unleſs we will ſay, that the Engliſh only are in ſuch faults incurable. Neither can it be pleaded, That ſuch Lands are given to pious uſes with ſuch a tacit condition, That, when abuſed, they may be recalled; ſo long as theſe abuſes are ſome other way remediable: for elſe, what thing is there dedicated to Gods Service; which ſome Poſſeſſors do not, at ſome time, abuſe? But if it be ſaid,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48657:59"/>that the abuſe and fault lies chiefly in the very Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Laws themſelves of ſuch Foundations: Yet are theſe Laws alſo capable of being rectified and reformed, ſo as God may be holily ſerved in ſuch a Monaſtick life; as the Proteſtants themſelves ſay he was, in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times. But, if the Monaſtick Laws here were ſo corrupt; how come the very ſame Laws abroad not to produce the ſame fruit, in Nations ſaid to be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſuch Vices? How come thoſe Houſes there, to this day to be not only tolerated, but reverenced? Or how happened, under the ſame Laws here, but three or four Years before, in the great Monaſteries, <hi>Religion, Thanks be to God, to be right well kept and obſerved?</hi> Stat. 27. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.28. c. But ſuppoſe the King had queſtioned the lawfulneſs of theſe Inſtitutions; yet was he no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge thereof; it being a Theological Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, and decided on the other ſide by the lawful judge thereof in ſeveral Superior Councils, as is ſhewed in <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> of <hi>Celibacy.</hi> But indeed that which leaves the King the more deſtitute of any Apology in this kind is; that, whereas the chief fault charged upon theſe cloiſtered People was Incontinency, the King, whilſt he took away theſe Orders, did juſtify this Vow, at leaſt of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Chaſtity,</hi> to be a Vow lawful, and by every one obſervable; as you may ſee in the fourth of the ſix Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Articles:</hi> and ſtill did prohibit all ſuch Perſons, as had taken this Vow, when in Monaſteries, from marrying afterward, when they were ejected; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Tranſgreſſors hereof to ſuffer death. The Words of that fourth <hi>Article</hi> are theſe,
<q>That the Vows of Chaſtity or Widow-hood by man or woman made to God adviſedly [i. e. <hi>as I ſuppoſe, deliberately; or, if you will, with the approbation of our Spiritual Father]</hi> ought to be obſerved by the Law of God; and that it exempteth them from other liberties of Chriſtian People, which without that <hi>[Vow]</hi> they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. The Penalty of which Article was, That if any, after a Vow adviſedly made, did marry; in ſo doing he ſhould be adjudged as a <hi>Felon;</hi> and loſe both Life,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48657:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>and forfeit Goods without any <hi>benefit of Clergy.</hi>
                        </q> See
<hi>Fox</hi> p. 1037. Now if any can make this Vow <hi>[ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly]</hi> I ſee not how we can ſay, that the Monks do not ſo; unleſs you will ſay, That any Breach of a Vow argues it not to have been formerly made with advice; but then, why are theſe Religious expreſly reſtrained afterward from Marrying? Stat. 31. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.6. c. where alſo <hi>[adviſedly]</hi> ſeems to be interpreted the vowing after One and Twenty Years old, uncompelled.</p>

Next then to look into the actions of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Sixth with relation to Church affairs. This Prince, being not yet ten years old when he came to the Crown, was chiefly directed and ſteered by Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer;</hi> and by his Uncle the Duke of
<hi>Somerſet,</hi> who was made Protector of his Perſon and Realm, not by the will of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who dreaded to truſt any one perſon with this Charge; but by the major part of thoſe ſixteen perſons, to whom in common he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the government of his Son and Kingdome. Of which Duke Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith p. 1180 and 1248,
<q>That he bare great favour to Gods word; and that he brought with him, to the State of that his Dignity, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient love and zeal Of the Goſpel and of Religion <hi>[he means, reformed.]</hi> The proof whereof (ſaith he p. 1183.1184.) was ſufficiently ſeen in his conſtant ſtanding to Gods truth, and zealous defence thereof againſt the Biſhops of <hi>Chicheſter, Norwich, Lincolne, London,</hi> and others moe, in the conſultation <hi>[about compoſing a new form of administring the Sacrament]</hi> had at <hi>Windſor</hi> in the firſt year of the King's Reign.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So inclined was the Protector; and ſo inclined were many of the Council;<note place="margin">§ 105. n.1.</note> and ſome of thoſe, who were otherwiſe, yet openly complyed with the prevailing party for ſecular ends; and, amongſt theſe, even <hi>Dudley</hi> the great Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the chief Agent in the later times of <hi>Edward;</hi> who confeſſed ſo much at his death: he then exhorting the people; See <hi>Stow</hi> An.

                        </q> Which calls to my mind likewiſe the death of <hi>Cromwel</hi> the great Agent for Reformation in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's days; who (then) renounced the Doctrines in this time called He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies; and took the people to witneſs, That he dyed in the Catholick Faith of the Holy Church, and doubted not in any Sacrament thereof [i. e. <hi>I ſuppoſe, as the Doctrine thereof was delivered in thoſe times, to be ſeen in the</hi> Neceſſary Doctrine <hi>before mentioned</hi>] See <hi>Fox</hi> pag.
1086. <hi>comp.</hi> Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> p. 462. As for thoſe of the Council who thus complyed not, they were, after ſome time, expelled; as Biſhop <hi>Tonſtal, Wriothſley</hi> the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor; and the Earl of <hi>Arundel, Goodwin</hi> p. 242. And as the Kings chief Governors in the Council, ſo his Under Tutors, who had the neareſt influence upon him, Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> and Sir <hi>John Cheek,</hi> were men much inclined to the Reformation: the one whereof in Queen
<hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s days Was made Biſhop of <hi>Ely;</hi> the other, being impriſoned in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, and upon it abjuring the reformed Religion,
<q>afterward (ſaith <hi>Goodwin</hi> pag. 287.) became ſo repentant for it; that out of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of grief he ſhortly languiſhed, and dyed.</q> Such were his neareſt Governors.</p>
                     <p>And the Complexion of his Parliament (for he had but one all his days continued by Prorogation from Seſſion to Seſſion,<note place="margin">§ 105. n. 2.</note> till at laſt it ended in the death of the King) you may learn from Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> (<hi>Hiſt.</hi> of
<hi>Reform,</hi> p. 48.)
<q>The Parliament (ſaith he) conſiſted of ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48657:65"/>as diſagreed amongſt themſelves in reſpect of Religion; yet agreed well enough together in one common Principle; which was to ſerve the preſent time, and preſerve themſelves. For tho a great part of the Nobility, and not a few of the chief Gentry in the Houſe of Commons, were cordially affected to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet were they willing to give way to all ſuch Acts and Statutes as were made againſt it; out of a fear of loſing ſuch Church-lands as they were poſſeſſed of, if that Religion ſhould prevail and get up again. And for the reſt, who either were to make or improve their fortunes; there is no queſtion to be made, but that they came reſolved to further ſuch a Reformation, as ſhould moſt viſibly conduce to the advancement of their ſeveral ends.</q> 
                        <hi>Thus he.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Kings Supremacy how far now ſome of the complying Clergy extended or acknowledged the juſt power thereof,<note place="margin">§ 105. n. 3.</note> even as to Ordination and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and adminiſtring the Word and Sacraments, I think I cannot more readily ſhew you, than by ſetting down the Queries propoſed concerning theſe things (in the firſt year of this Kings, Reign) to Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and other Biſhops and Learned Men, when aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Windſor</hi> for eſtabliſhing a publick Order for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service; and the Arch-Biſhops anſwer to them (printed lately by Mr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> out of a Manuſcript of this Arch-Biſhop. (<hi>Iren.</hi> 2. Par. 8 chap.) The firſt Query is,
<q>Whether the Apoſtles lacking a higher power, as in not having a Chriſtian King among them, made Biſhops by that neceſſity; or by authority given them of God?</q> To which the Arch-Biſhop anſwers to the King, firſt in general;
<q>That all Chriſtian Princes have committed unto them immediately of God the whole cure of all their Subjects, as well concerning the adminiſtration of Gods word for the cure of Souls, as concerning the miniſtration of things Political; That the Miniſters of Gods word under his Majeſty be die Biſhops, Parſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> That the ſaid Miniſters be appointed in every State by the Laws and Orders of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48657:65"/>Kings;
<q>That in the admiſſion of many of theſe Officers be divers comely Ceremonies uſed; which be not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but only for a good order and ſeemly faſhion That there is no more promiſe of God, that Grace is given in the committing the Eccleſiaſtical office; than it is in the committing the Civil.</q> 
                        <hi>Then he anſwers more particularly,</hi>
                        <q>That in the Apoſtles time, when there was no Chriſtian Princes, by whoſe authority Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Gods word might be appointed <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes the Apoſtles and others, unto whom God had given abundantly the Spirit, ſent or appointed Miniſters of Gods word; ſometimes the people did chooſe ſuch as they thought meet thereunto. And when appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtles; the people of their own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary will did accept them, not for the Supremity, Impery or Dominion, that the Apoſtles had over them to command as their Princes or Maſters; but as good people ready to obey the advice of good Councellors.</q> A ſecond Query is,
<q>Whether Biſhops, or Prieſts, were firſt? And if the Prieſts were firſt; whether then the Prieſt made the Biſhop? He anſwers, That Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts were at one time; and were not two things, but both one office in the beginning of Chriſt's Religion. The third Query. Whether a Biſhop hath authority, to make a Prieſt, by the Scriptures, or no? And whether any other [i.e. <hi>Secular perſon</hi>] but only a Biſhop may make a Prieſt? He anſwers. A Biſhop may make a Prieſt by the Scriptures; and ſo may Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Governors alſo, and that by authority of God committed unto them; and the people alſo by their Election. The fourth Query. Whether in the New Teſtament be required any Conſecration of a Biſhop and Prieſt; or only appointing to the office be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? Anſwer. In the New Teſtament he that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be a Biſhop or a Prieſt needeth no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration by the Scripture; for election or appointing thereto is ſufficient. The fifth Query. Whether (if it fortuned a Prince Chriſtian learned to conquer cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dominions of Infidels, having none but temporal
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48657:66"/>learned men with him) it be defended by Gods Law, That he and they ſhould preach and teach the Word of God there, or no? And alſo make and conſtitute Prieſts, or no?</q> 
                        <hi>[In the next Query, which I omit for brevity ſake, is mentioned alſo the miniſtring Baptiſm and other Sacraments.]</hi> He anſwers to this and the next,
<q>That it is not againſt Gods Law: but (contrary) they ought indeed ſo to do. The ſeventh Query. Whether a Biſhop or a Prieſt may excommunicate; and for what Crimes? And whether they, only, may excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, by Gods law? He anſwers, A Biſhop or a Prieſt, by the Scriptures, is neither commanded nor forbidden to excommunicate. But where the Laws of any Region giveth him authority to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; there they ought to uſe the ſame in ſuch crimes, as the laws have ſuch authority in: And where the laws of the Region forbiddeth them; there they have none authority at all; and they, that be no Prieſts, may alſo excommunicate, if the law allow thereunto.</q> Thus the Arch-Biſhop explains the Kings and Clergies power and right, concluding,
<q>That he doth not te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merariouſly define this his opinion and ſentence; but remits the Judgment thereof wholly to his Majeſty.</q> This Text needs no Comment; it is plain enough: and perhaps poſterity might have done better to have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this nakedneſs of their Forefather; then to have publiſhed it after ſo long a ſilence.<label type="milestone">

<q>which Preachers at every Seſſion ſhould inſtruct the people in the true Doctrine of the Goſpel; and dehort them from their old Superſtition and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And that they might be more orderly directed in this their Commiſſion, there were delivered unto them certain Injuctions and Eccleſiaſtical Orders, drawn up by the Kings learned Council; the which they ſhould command, in his Majeſties behalf, to be thenceforth obſerved of every perſon, to whom they did appertain, within their ſundry Circuits.</q> [<hi>Theſe Injuctions (as we find in the Kings Preface to them) are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48657:68"/>to both Clergy and Laity, for the ſuppreſſion of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Superſtition; and the extirpation of enormities and abuſes; by the King ſupreme authority aſſiſted by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his most dear <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle the Duke of</hi> Somerſet, <hi>and the eſidue of his moſt honorable Council.</hi>] And of the ſame univerſal Viſitation made by the Kings appointment thus ſpeak the <hi>Antiquit.

Whereas the Church that uſeth ſuch private Maſles, wiſheth, that the Prieſt might never communicate alone, but if this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen, which is not the Prieſts fault, the Church doth not therefore command this Sacrifice of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt to be omitted: <hi>quod Sacrificium a publico Eccleſiae miniſtro non pro ſe tantum, ſed pro omnibus fidelibus, qui ad Chriſti corpus pertinent, celebratur.</hi> See <hi>Conc.

<q>Nevertheleſs (ſaith he) as at no time any thing can be ſo well done of the godly, but that the wicked will find ſome means to deface the ſame: ſo likewiſe at this preſent, thro the perverſe obſtinacy and diſſembling frowardneſs of many inferiour Prieſts and Miniſters of Cathedral and other Churches of this Realm, there did ariſe a marvellous Schiſm and variety of faſhions in celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Common Service, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church. For ſome zealouſly allowing the Kings proceedings, did gladly follow the order thereof; and others, though not ſo willingly admitting them, did yet diſſemblingly and patchingly uſe ſome part of them: but many careleſly contemning all would ſtill
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48657:74"/>exerciſe their old wonted Popery [i. e, <hi>in other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> would ſtill retain the former ſolemn Church Service.]</q>

<q>What a Babylonical confuſion (ſaith he) in the two firſt years of the Kings Reign enſued upon theſe innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all Churches, is wonderful to recount. For ſome Prieſts ſaid the Latine Maſs; ſome the Engliſh Communion; ſome both; ſome neither; ſome half of the one, half of the other. This was very ordinary, to ſay the <hi>Introitus &amp; Confiteor</hi> in Engliſh; and then the Collects, and ſome other parts in Latine: after that again, the Epiſtles and Goſpels in Engliſh, and then the Canon of the Maſs in Latine; and laſtly the Benediction and laſt Goſpel in Engliſh. But that which was of more importance and impiety; ſome did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate Bread and Wine, others did not: but would tell the people before-hand, That they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate, but reſtore them their Bread and Wine back again, as they received it from them; only adding to it the Church's benediction. And thoſe, that did conſecrate, did conſecrate in divers forms; ſome aloud, ſome in ſecret; ſome in one form of words, ſome in another. And, after Conſecration, ſome held up the Hoſt to be adored after the old faſhion, and ſome did not; and, of thoſe that were preſent, ſome did kneel down and adore, others did ſhut their eyes, others turn away their faces, others run out of the Church crving <hi>Idolatry. Hitherto</hi> Parſons.

<q>That it was no ſmall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48657:74"/>of ſorrow unto them to underſtand by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of many that the ſaid Book; ſo much travelled for, remaineth in many places of the Realm, either not known at all, or not uſed; or if uſed, very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and that in ſuch a light and irreverent ſort, that <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The fault whereof <hi>[ſay they to the Biſhop]</hi> we muſt of reaſon impute to you, and others of your vocation.

<q>Even of the greateſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates (ſaith he) ſome ſpurned privily; and would not ſpare to ſpeak evil of thoſe Preachers, who went about moſt wholſomely to cure their ſore backs.

                        <hi>Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Biſhop</hi> Ridley. Where note; that ſome outward compliance, at the firſt, of thoſe Biſhops, who made an open oppoſition afterward, might be upon a fair pretence; becauſe the firſt Acts of the Reformation might be not ſo unſupportable, as the later: for the Reformation winded and inſinuated it ſelf into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice by certain gentle degrees; the greateſt blow to the former doctrine and diſcipline of the Church being given in the later times of this Kings Reign, when it was now by ſome ſucceſs grown more bold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident.

Again; the perpetual outward compliance of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops contrarily affected, ſince there preceded before it penalties, and fears, and the ſeeing of the prime Biſhops to be impriſoned and ejected for ſtanding our, is far from an authentical conſent, and unjuſtly reckoned as ſuch. For tho none can know mens hearts but by their outward appearance; yet where mens votes are asked after penalties, impriſonments of others, threats <hi/> which are ſo ſtrong motives of diſſimulation: now all that conform in theſe, are to be preſumed compilers; and none free voters.</p>

<hi>Edward</hi> till the fifth year of his Government; of which I ſhall ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

<q>That Reformation of Gods worſhip may be warrantably done without a foregoing Synodical vote; where there is juſt and apparent cauſe of fearing more danger from the perſons, which are to be convocated, and the times wherein they are to aſſemble.

And (ſaith he) how far this was conſiderable in the beginning of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign [i. e, <hi>till the King had otherwiſe moulded the Members of the Synod</hi>] or whether ſuch fear made them forbear to put it at firſt to a Synodical Vote, I cannot ſay.</q> Thus Dr. <hi>Fern.</hi>

<q>Which reviving (ſaith he) of the ancient Forms of Gods worſhip rather than the introduction of a new, as the King <hi>[Edward]</hi> did here in <hi>England</hi> by his own authority, the body of the Clergy not conſulted in it; ſo, poſſibly, there might be good reaſon, why thoſe, who had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Kings Affairs, thought it not ſafe to put the managing of the buſineſs to a Convocation;</q> 
                        <hi>[and then having ſhewed that ſuch change of Religion would be both againſt the reputation and profit of the Clergy, he goes on.]</hi>
                        <q>So that as well in point of reputation, as of profit, beſides the love which many of them had to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Mumpſimus,</hi> it was moſt probable; that ſuch an hard piece of Reformation would not eaſily down, had it been put into the power of a Convocation; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under a Prince in nonage, and a State unſettled.</q> 
                        <hi>Thus he.</hi> As for that which afterward he ſaith: <hi>That this was paſſed by the Biſhops, when it paſſed in Parliament, the Biſhops making the most conſiderable van of the Houſe of Peers,</hi> It is anſwered by what hath been ſaid before §. 11. n. 2.

See likewiſe what the ſame Dr. ſaith on the ſame ſubject in 1. Par. 6. §. p.
36; where, after doubting, whether ſeveral particulars of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reformation were done of the Kings meer motion, or by advice of his Council, or by Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion With his Biſhops; (For (ſaith he) <hi>there is little left
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48657:79"/>upon record of the Convocation of that time, more than the Articles of the year</hi> 1552) He ſpeaks alſo of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Reformation done after the ſame ſort,
<q>Thus alſo (ſaith he) in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, before the new Biſhops were well ſetled, and the Queen aſſured of the affection of her Clergy; ſhe went that way to work in the Reformation, which her two Predeceſſors [<hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi>] had done before her, in the well ordering of the Church; ſhe publiſhed her Injunctions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when the times were better ſetled, and the firſt difficulties of her Reign paſſed over; ſhe left Church-work to the diſpoſing of Church-men: who by their place and calling were moſt proper for it; and they being met in Convocation did make Canons <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> And thus if a Prince, according to the Sect which himſelf and his Council favours, may take the liberty, with coactive power, to reform at the firſt againſt his Clergy: he, within a ſhort time no doubt, may ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>leave the Church-work to Church-men</hi> (as the Dr. ſaith) and juſtify his Reformation by his Clergy, that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther changed firſt; or terrified.</p>

For I ask: Suppoſe the Clergy generally had oppoſed them, were theſe Injunctions juſtly impoſed upon them by the King or not? If not; Then neither were they juſtly impoſed, tho the Clergy had conſented; becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed before they conſented, whoſe conſent is held ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that they may be juſtly impoſed.

W hen therefore the conſent of Synod or Convocation is urged, to the people or to ſome ſingle perſon, by the King, or his Council; it is not urged, as an authority (ſee the reaſon §. 45.) which theſe, as ſubject to their decrees, ought to obey; but as an example, which theſe, as leſs knowing, ought to follow. But if the bare mentioning ſometimes of the Clergy's conſent argues this then thought neceſſary to the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of ſuch decrees; then would the mentioning of the conſent of Parliament argue as much, which is urged together with that of the Clergy; and ſo no Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Acts of the King and Clergy would be obligatory, unleſs confirmed by Parliament. But this will deſtroy the authority of the 42 Articles made in the fifth year
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48657:80"/>of King <hi>Edward;</hi> ratified by no Parliament.</p>

The Form of adminiſtring the Communion ſuffered three Alterations or Reformations one after another; the later ſtill departing further from the ancient Form uſed in the Church than the former. Firſt the King: aſſembled certain Biſhops and others at <hi>Windſor</hi> in the firſt year of his Reign (ſuch as he pleaſed to appoint) to compile a new Form of celebrating the Communion <hi>according to the Rule</hi> (ſaith <hi>Fox</hi> p. 1184) <hi>of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, and firſt uſage of the Primitive Church.</hi> Yet the Biſhops at this time ſo ordered and moderated the matter (which perhaps may be the reaſon of thoſe words in

                        <hi>That the Protector at</hi> Windſor <hi>in the zealous defence of Gods truth oppoſed the Biſhops</hi>) that the whole office of the Maſs ſhould proceed as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the Latine, even to the very end of the Canon, and the receiving of the Sacrament by the Prieſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Which done the Prieſt is appointed to begin the exhortation in Engliſh. <hi>[We be come together at this time Dearly Beloved &amp;c.]</hi> as it is in the preſent Engliſh Liturgy. After which follows alſo the diſſwaſion of great offenders impenitent from receiving, the General Confeſſion and Abſolution, the Prayer <hi>[We preſume not &amp;c.]</hi> and ſo the adminiſtration of the Euchariſt to the people in both kinds. The words of the Rubrick in that firſt Order of the Communion reprinted at <hi>London</hi>
61 are theſe,
<q>The time of the Communion <hi>[of the people]</hi> ſhall be immediately after that the Prieſt ſhall have received the Sacrament, without the varying of any other Rite or Ceremony in the Maſs (until other order ſhall be provided.) But as heretofore uſually the Prieſt hath done with the Sacrament of the Body, to prepare bleſs and conſecrate ſo much as will ſerve the people, ſo it ſhall yet continue ſtill after the ſame manner and form; ſave that, he ſhall bleſs and conſecrate the biggeſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48657:84"/>or ſome fair and convenient Cup or Cups full of Wine with ſome water put unto it, and that day, not drink it up all himſelf; but taking one only ſup or draught leave the reſt upon the Altar covered, and thus exhort the people, <hi>Dearly beloved</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Thus the Rubrick.</hi> And this Form (as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> goes on) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited unto the King was by his Majeſty's Council particularly ſent to every Biſhop of the Realm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring and commanding them, by their Letters on the Kings Majeſty's behalf, that they ſhould forthwith have diligent reſpect to the due execution thereof <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which Letter the motive urged by the Council why this new Form was drawn up and impoſed, is; That the Statute of the former Parliament, ordering that the Sacrament ſhould be diſtributed unto the people in both kinds, might be well executed, in ſuch ſort as is agreeable with the word of God <hi>[as if for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the Sacrament in both kinds there was any need of altering or ſuperadding any thing to the Maſs; when as, with that ſame Form of the Maſs it was in the publick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, for many Centuries, only ſo diſtributed; and when as that ſame Form of the Maſs is urged by Proteſtants, as contrary to communicating the people only in one kind; but the true cauſe of altering it I ſhall ſhew you by and by.]</hi>
                        </q> Now this new Form was thus impoſed by the King and his Council, before allowed by any Synod of the Clergy, or Act of Parliament; which were procured afterward in the ſecond Parliament of King <hi>Edward.</hi> Meanwhile ſuch alterations in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time about the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the Adminiſtration of this Sacrament as they were uncanonical, ſo they were, in this reſpect, alſo very hurtful; in that they occaſioned (in the ignorant eſpecially) much profaneneſs and irreverence toward the Bleſſed Sacrament in thoſe days; as you may partly alſo gather from an Act (1. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.1. c.) made againſt ſuch irreverent ſpeaking againſt it. For whereas the Sacrament was, according to ancient cuſtome, delivered to each Communicant in a ſmall round Wafer, hence they gave it the name of <hi>Round-Robin.</hi> And becauſe the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48657:85"/>parts thereof, that were reſerved to be carried to the ſick, were hanged up over the Altar in a Pix or Box; they named it <hi>Jack in a Box;</hi> and inſtead of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar, called it <hi>the Sacrament of the Halter.</hi> (See <hi>Heylin</hi>'s

<q>That, whereas of long time there had been in the Realm divers Forms of Common Prayer, the uſe of <hi>Sarum,</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> of <hi>Bangor</hi> and <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne;</hi> and beſides the ſame, now of late much more divers and ſundry Forms and Faſhions have been uſed
<hi>&amp;c:</hi> to ſtay Innovation and Rites concerning the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; his Highneſs, being pleaſed to bear with the frailty and weakneſs of his ſubjects in that behalf, hath appointed the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> &amp;c. having as well reſpect to the moſt pure Chriſtian Religion taught by the Scripture, as to the uſages in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, to draw and make one convenient and meet order, rite and faſhion of Common-Prayer and Adminiſtration to be had and uſed in his Majeſty's Realms.</q>

For 1. every one, that hath committed ſuch ſin, as is ſuppoſed to have put him out of the State of Grace, and out of his Baptiſmal Regeneration (for which only the Church requires Sacerdotal Confeſſion) either hath, or ought to have (and probably would have, if the Clergy taught him ſo) his Conſcience troubled; till he hath obtained a new reconciliation to God, by thoſe whom God hath appointed to do this office for him; 2. But if his private repentance, when this is done proportionably to his offence, is ſufficient for his recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; yet what grievous ſinner, after much repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ought not ſtill to be troubled concerning the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines of it, till he hath conſulted, in ſuch an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, his ſpiritual Father much more knowing therein than himſelf? And then if all ſuch ought to be troubled; all ought to confeſs. Indeed lets trouble of mind is many times a ſign of leſs penitence; and, of ſuch high offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, thoſe have moſt need of the Prieſt's cure, who are leaſt troubled. And thoſe who are leaſt troubled, ought to be ſo much the more troubled, that they are ſo little troubled: and ought to go to the Prieſt and confeſs ſuch ſin, that he may excite them to greater trouble and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for it, and may put them to ſome pain in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wound to the bottome, that ſo it may be more capable of cure. And on the other ſide; thoſe, who in, and after long penitence, and even from all their life, are much troubled for ſuch their crimes, are likely to be the beſt penitents; and conſequently to have leaſt need of Sacerdotal Confeſſion for the examining of their repentance: which examination, and not conſolation, I

But then add to this; that when once ſuch Sacerdotal Confeſſion for great ſinners is commanded by the Church (<hi>i. e.</hi> by a lawful ſuperior Council) to be obſerved, as neceſſary, <hi>jure divino,</hi> or by divine Inſtitution, Now, it comes to paſs, that tho ſuch Confeſſion were ſuppoſed not neceſſary to be obſerved or practiſed from any ſuch divine inſtitution; yet, after decreed by ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, (as who have authority to impoſe it alſo upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other motives; from which they think it the moſt beneficial and the ſecureſt courſe for ſuch ſinners ſo to do;) it becomes neceſſary to be practiſed and obſerved as the Church's conſtitution, even by thoſe, who think it not neceſſary <hi>jure divino.</hi> 4. But yet further; were not ſuch Church-conſtitution in this reſpect obliging; yet when as a thing is ſo far diſputable and doubtful, whether <hi>jure divino,</hi> as that ſuch a judgment, as this of a ſuperiour Council, hath declared, it ſo; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the otherſide we our ſelves grant thus much, that ſuch thing, if not neceſſary, is very beneficial, and may upon this title be lawfully enjoyned by the Church's Superiors: reaſon will dictate here, that it is the moſt prudent way, both for the Subjects of a particular Church to obſerve it; and for the Superiors of ſuch Church to enjoyn it, upon pain of incurring their cenſures, to be obſerved. But now to return to our buſineſs.]</p>

Yet, of ſeveral of thoſe things, which he would have to be changed, he confeſſed, both that they were ancient, and might in ſome manner be inculpably uſed, but yet thought it better that they ſhould be removed: 1. becauſe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in Scripture by word or example: 2. becauſe they might be, or alſo had been, abuſed'to ſuperſtition: 3. becauſe the Church ſhould partake as little as might be of the ſame uſages with Anti-Chriſt. <hi>Bucer</hi> Cenſur. in Ordinat. <hi>Eccleſ.

<q>Whereas its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the Adminiſtration of the Lord's Supper, that the Communicants kneeling ſhould receive the Holy Communion, which thing is well meant for a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48657:95"/>ſignification of the humble and grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the benefits of Chriſt given unto the worthy receiver, and to avoid the profanation and diſorders which about the Holy Communion might elſe enſue: Leſt yet the ſame kneeling might be thought or taken otherwiſe, we do declare that it is not meant thereby, that any Adoration is done or ought to be done either unto the Sacramental Bread or Wine there bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or unto any real and eſſential Preſence there being of Chriſt's natural Fleſh and Blood. For as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sacramental Bread and Wine, they remain ſtill in their natural ſubſtances, and therefore may not be adored; for that were Idolatry. And as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural Body and Blood of our Saviour Chriſt, they are in heaven and not here: for it is againſt the truth of Chriſt's true natural Body to be in moe places than one at one time.</q> Thus that Rubrick; thought fit to be omitted in the Common-Prayer-Book of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> of which ſee the Reaſon below § 179. n. 2. Accordingly the Altar was changed into a Table (the ſides whereof were ſet North and South) ſet near the Reading-place; ordered, at the Communion time, to be covered with a fair white Linnen Cloth; the other veſtments prohibited; ſave only a Surplice for a Prieſt, and Rochet for a Biſhop; and to take away all Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, the Communion Bread appointed to be ſuch as is uſually eaten at the Table; but the pureſt of that ſort that can conveniently be had, <hi>See the Rubricks of King</hi> Edward's <hi>ſecondCommon Prayer-Book Fol.</hi>

<q>As for the Records of this Convocation (ſaith he) they are but one degree above blanks, ſcarce affording the names of the Clerks aſſembled therein (for which ſee alſo
<hi>Heylin</hi>'s <hi>Hiſt. of Reform. King Edw.</hi> p. 121.) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they had no Commiſſion from the King to meddle with Church-buſineſs; and no Convocation can hear complaints in Religion, nor ſpeak in redreſs thereof, till a Commiſſion be granted unto it from Regal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Now the true reaſon, why the King would not entruſt the diffuſive body of the Convocation with a power to meddle with matters of Religion, was a juſt jealouſy, which he had, of the ill-affection of the major part thereof; who, under a fair rind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Profeſſion, had the rotten core of Roman Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. It was therefore conceived ſafer for the King to rely on the ability and fidelity of ſome ſelect confidents cordial to the cauſe of Religion, than to adventure the ſame to be diſcuſſed and decided by a ſuſpected Convocation. However this barren Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is entitled the Parent of thoſe Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, 42 in number, which are printed with this Preface; <hi>Articuli, de quibus</hi> &amp;c. as is recited before. With theſe Articles was bound a Catechiſme, younger in age, as bearing date of the next year, but of the ſame extract, relating to this Convocation as Author thereof. Indeed it was firſt compiled, as appears in the Kings Patent prefixed, by a ſingle Divine (character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pious and learned:) but afterwards peruſed and allowed by the Biſhops and other learned men (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it the Convocation;) and by Royal authority commended to all Subjects, commanded to all School-Matters to teach their Scholars. Yet very few in the Convocation ever ſaw it; much leſs explicitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48657:100"/>in that it beareth the Title of the <hi>Synod of London</hi> laſt before this; altho many of them, which then were preſent, were never made privy thereof in ſetting it forth: for that this houſe had granted the authority to make Eccleſiaſtical Laws unto certain perſons to be appointed by the Kings Majeſty; and whatſoever Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Laws they or the moſt part of them did ſet forth,<note place="margin">3, 4.

<hi>Anſwer</hi> returned thereto. But to clear the matter a little further; We find in the ſame
<hi>Fox</hi> p. 1704, after this, Arch-biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> in his tryal before the Commiſſioners at <hi>Oxford,</hi> (<hi>Brooks</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and others) charged amongſt other things with being the <hi>Author of this Catechiſme and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and with <hi>compelling men</hi> againſt their wills <hi>to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe</hi> them; the former of which he there confeſſeth; but denyeth the latter.

                        <q>That the ſaid <hi>Tho.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>169</label> Having given you theſe three relations, now to reflect a little on them. Firſt, if you well conſider the words in the Title of the Articles, <hi>de quibus inter Epiſcopos &amp; alios eruditos viros</hi> &amp;c. they ſeem not the ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſion of a Synodal Act which runs more generally; as thus <hi>[de quibus convenit inter Archiepiſcopos, Epiſcopos, &amp; Clerum univerſum]</hi> or the like. Next, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that tho the <hi>Prolocutor</hi> in the Synod 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                        <hi>Mariae</hi> queſtioneth, and
<hi>Philpot</hi> anſwereth concerning the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, why it ſhould be publiſhed in the name of the Synod; yet they both ſpeak, not of the Catechiſme taken by it ſelf; but only of the Articles which were firſt printed at the end of this Catechiſme, and bound up with it; which the Prolocutor therefore calls the <hi>Articles of the Catechiſme,</hi> and propoſeth the matter of the 28th of theſe Articles for diſputation; and ſo alſo calleth them the
<hi>Catechiſme,</hi> becauſe the firſt title of this Book is <hi>Catechiſmus brevis</hi> &amp;c. Now that they muſt ſpeak of the Articles is plain; becauſe the Catechiſme as taken by it ſelf is not at all entitled to the Synod; but only the Articles at the end thereof. The Title of the Catechiſme is only this <hi>Catechiſmus brevis Chriſtianae diſciplinae ſummam continens omnibus Ludimagiſtris autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate regiâ commendatus.</hi> Neither do thoſe words in <hi>Philpot</hi>'s Anſwer [<hi>that the houſe had committed their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodal authority to certain perſons to be appointed by the King to make ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Laws as they thought convenient</hi> &amp;c.] agree at all to this Catechiſme; but to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles only. For this Catechiſme was made before by a private perſon (that is, by the Arch-biſhop, if we may believe his own confeſſion related above) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward approved only by ſome Biſhops and other <hi>eruditi viri,</hi> as the King ſaith in the Preface thereof. <hi>Cum bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis &amp; explicata Catechiſmi ratio a pio quodam &amp; erudito viro conſcripta nobis ad cognoſcendum offerretur, ejus dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentem

Neither is this Catechiſme ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from the Articles any ſuch peſtiferous Book, or ſo full of Hereſies, as the <hi>Prolocutor</hi> complains of; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compoſed in general terms for School-boys; and not ſtating, ſcarce touching, any controverſy. Add to this, that, tho the Catechiſme was not made by the Synod, yet if the 42 Articles that were then printed and bound with the Catechiſme, were framed by it; neither had the Prolocutor any reaſon to have fallen upon and gotten hands againſt the Catechiſme, as being falſly aſcribed to that Reverend Aſſembly, (when as, that, which was far more oppoſite to that which he accounted the Orthodox Religion, (namely theſe Articles) were known to be paſſed by them;) Neither would
<hi>Philpot</hi> have concealed this matter; ſince this known Act of the Synod compoſing theſe Articles would have juſtified that Act of the Delegates compoſing the Catechiſme; for the Doctrine of the Catechiſme is contained in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. But, if by this Catechiſme both the <hi>Prolocutor</hi> and <hi>Philpot</hi> meant the Articles at the end thereof, (as it cannot be otherwiſe) then <hi>Philpot</hi> hath revealed to us all the truth concerning the compoſing or ratifying of them; and why, in the impreſſion, they were aſcribed to the Synod: Namely becauſe the Synod had given authority to thoſe the King ſhould nominate, to make Eccleſiaſtical Laws; and ſo by thoſe perſons (being <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi. &amp; alii eruditi viri</hi>) were theſe Articles compiled or confirmed; the Synod it ſeems leaving both this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the election of the perſons for doing of it to the Kings care, without reſerving any review thereof to themſelves, contrary to the Firſt, Second and Sixth <hi>Theſes.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> diſcovers the motive which this Synod (if he meant this, and not ſome former Synod) might have to do this, when he mentions a former
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48657:101"/>Act of Parliament, 3, 4. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.11. c. enſtating the King in this power; which Act was made two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Seſſion of this Synod: but then this is ſomewhat ſtrange, that what was acknowledged (formerly) as the Kings right, is (now) made by Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> the Clergy's conceſſion to him. Thus then were theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles made, not by, but after, the Synod: and this is the reaſon, why tho the production of ſuch a Body of Articles would have been by much the ſolemneſt Act of a Synod, that was done in King
<hi>Edward</hi>'s days; yet both the Records and the Hiſtorians, <hi>Fox, Godwin, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitates Britanicae,</hi> and thoſe others, that I have ſeen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ſilent therein. And the Arch-biſhop, to whom it would have been an excellent defence, to have ſhewed them, tho of his compiling, yet to have been confirmed and generally ſubſcribed by ſuch a full Synod; yet he alſo pleads no ſuch thing. And hence we may learn the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that which Dr.
<hi>Heylin</hi> obſerveth p. 25.
<q>That tho a Parliament was held at this very time, and that this Parliament had paſſed ſeveral Acts, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Church-matters, as, an Act for <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity of Divine Service,</hi> and for the <hi>Confirmation of the Book of Ordination</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.1. c. An Act declaring, <hi>which days ſhall only be kept for Holy</hi>-days, and which for
<hi>Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>-days. 3. c. An Act againſt <hi>ſtriking</hi> or drawing any weapon <hi>in the Church,</hi> or Church-yard. 4. c. An Act for the <hi>legitimating of the Marriages of Priests.</hi> 12. c.: Yet neither in this Parliament (ſaith he) nor in that which followed, is there ſo much as the leaſt Syllable which reflecteth this way, or medleth any thing at all with the Book of Articles.</q> 
                        <hi>Thus Dr.</hi> Heylin. Which Obſervation, as to him it affords an Argument, that Religion reformed in theſe Articles therefore can be called <hi>no Parliament-Religion;</hi> ſo to me, that it was alſo no <hi>Synodal-Religion:</hi> becauſe we ſee the Parliaments in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time corroborating or rather prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Synod in all other Tranſactions about the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. See before, §. 47. Neither can it be ſaid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to the Parliament to enjoyn obedience to theſe,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48657:102"/>as well as it had done to other Church- or Synod-decrees.</p>

Only let me firſt mind you this concerning Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> Reign that lyeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween; That whatever the Reformation had built upon any Synodal vote under <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, or <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, was now revoked and demoliſhed under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by the like Synods of a legal Clergy; as is ſhewed before §. 52. The Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical matters was re-acknowledged by this National Synod, now, not due to the Civil, but to the Eccleſiaſtical, Chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the Weſt: yet not challenged by him in ſo high a degree, as theſe Princes uſed it. The Six <hi>Articles,</hi> eſtabliſhed by Synod
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48657:102"/>in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's days, as alſo the ancient <hi>Church Liturgy,</hi> ancient <hi>Form of Ordination,</hi> ancient way of <hi>Tryal of Hereticks,</hi> ancient <hi>Canons</hi> &amp;c, were now by the like Synodal power again reſtored, and re-inforced. See before, §. 48. So that the Reformation under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was to begin upon a new foundation, without grounding any plea upon any Synodal Act or conſent of the Clergy made in King <hi>Henry</hi> or King <hi>Edward</hi> s days; either concerning the new Supremacy, or the new Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, or the new 42 Articles of Religion, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> ſince all theſe were by the ſame Synodal authority in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days deſclaimed.

<hi>Mary</hi>'s Synods will void King <hi>Henry</hi>'s and King <hi>Edward</hi>'s: But if of former Synods, rather than of later; then the Synods of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and of former times for the Six Articles <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will void King <hi>Edward</hi>'s and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s too.</p>

<hi>Elizabeth</hi> took in repairing the Reformation defaced by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Heylin</hi> ſpeaks thus of it in general. <hi>Reform. Juſtified,</hi> p. 37.
<q>In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time (ſaith he) before the new Biſhops were well ſetled, and the Queen aſſured of the affections of her Clergy, She went that way to work in her Reformation, which not only her two Predeceſſors, but all the godly Kings and Princes in the Jewiſh State, and many of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors in the Primitive times, had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her; in the well ordering of the Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple committed to their care and government by God. And to that end ſhe publiſhed her <hi>Injunctions An. Dom.</hi> 1559. A Book of <hi>Orders</hi>
1561. Another of <hi>Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> 1562. all tending unto the Reformation; with the advice and counſel of the Metropolitan <hi>[him, that was firſt ordained ſo by her appointment]</hi> and ſome other godly Prelates, who were then about her: by whom they were agreed on, and ſubſcribed unto, before they were preſented to her. But when the times were better ſetled, and the firſt difficulties of her Reign paſſed over;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48657:103"/>ſhe left Church work to the diſpoſing of Church-men, who by their place and calling were moſt proper for it: and they being met in Convocation, and thereto authorized, as the Laws required, did make and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſeveral Books of <hi>Canons</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                        <hi>Thus the Doctor.</hi> The brief of which is, That Queen <hi>Elizabeth did the Church-work at firſt her ſelf without any Synodal authority of the Church-men</hi> (as not being aſſured of their affection) <hi>till ſhe had ſetled new Church-men according to her mind; and then ſhe did Church-work, by Church-men.</hi>

<hi>Bonner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the Arch-Biſhoprick of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> was Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident; and Dr. <hi>Harpsfield</hi> was Prolocutor for the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Clergy. But this Synod continued in the former reſolutions made under Queen
<hi>Mary;</hi> and remained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible to the Queens inclinations, and the Reformation: nay, declared againſt it. The full relation of which Synod I will give you out of Mr.
<hi>Fuller</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory</hi> 9. l. p. 54. (who copyed it out of <hi>Lib. Synod,</hi> 1559.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tho ſomewhat long, yet it is very remarkable.
<q>The Convocation at this time (ſaith he) was very ſmall and ſilent. For as it is obſerved in nature, when one twin is of an unuſual ſtrength and bigneſs, the other born with him is weak and dwindleth away: So here, this Parliament being very active in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Convocation, younger brother thereunto, was little employed, leſs regarded. Yet in it; in the lower Houſe of Convocation were paſſed over certain Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Religion; which they tendred to the Biſhops, that they might preſent them to the Parliament. The Biſhops likewiſe by their <hi>Preſident</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them to the Lord <hi>Keeper.</hi> Likewiſe in the tenth Seſſion of this Convocation an account was given in by both the

In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Queſtion, it ſeems to me ſomewhat ſtrange; that, whereas the Convocation ſpeaks chiefly of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of defining points <hi>de fide;</hi> and contends, that the authority of defining ſuch points belongs not to the Laity, or to any Civil Power, but only <hi>ad Paſtores;</hi> and whereas alſo the main of the Reformation conſiſts in altering ſuch Doctrines belonging to Faith, and not in altering ſome Rites and Ceremonies: yet the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here ſtretcheth no further than to <hi>Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;</hi> and then ſpeaks of theſe as alterable, not by the Laity, or a Civil Power, but by a particular Church; <hi>i. e.</hi> as I ſuppoſe, by the Clergy thereof.

Again; in the laſt queſtion, it ſeems as ſtrange; that, whereas the Convocation in their Preface founds this Article toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the reſt on Primitive and Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as well as on Scripture: <hi>Publico chriſtianarum gentium conſenſu</hi> &amp;c. <hi>atque ab</hi> Apoſtolis <hi>ad not uſque</hi> &amp;c.

<q>That all came to nothing: for that, after a few words paſſed to and fro in writing, they could not agree about the manner of diſputing. The Proteſtants triumphing, as if they had gotten the victory; and the Papiſts complaining, that they were hardly dealt withal, in that they were not forewarned of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions above a day or two before: and that Lord Keeper

<q>And ſo hot were the Biſhops of <hi>Lincolne</hi> and <hi>Winchester,</hi> that they thought meet, that the Queen and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this falling away from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be ſtricken with the cenſure of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<hi>attributed</hi> and profeſſed <hi>to the Prince;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Concerning Regal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy. How far it ſeemeth to extend.</note> and a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy <hi>denyed</hi> and renounced
<hi>to any Forreign power.</hi> And that I may ſpeak more diſtinctly in this matter. 1. As to the firſt of theſe, thus much is freely conceded: That the Civil Magiſtrate hath a Supremacy in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Eccleſiaſtical Affairs; and that ſuch as none other hath; namely this: An external coactive power or juriſdiction committed to him by God, to enjoyn to his Subjects the obſervance of the Laws of the Church; and of the Laws of God, as they are declared to him to be ſuch by the Church: and to reſtrain and puniſh the tranſgreſſors of them, whether Clergy or Laity, within his Dominions, with the Civil Sword, which God hath put only into his hands. So that no Canons of the Church can be by the Eccleſiaſticks or others, executed or enforced on the Subject as Laws, <hi>viz. with external Coaction,</hi> pecuniary or corporal
<hi>mulcts or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> &amp;c. before the Secular Prince is pleaſed to admit ſuch Canons and enroll them amongſt his Laws, or to concede ſuch coactive power to his Clergy. How far alſo the Kings Supremacy may extend over all Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical perſons concerning the
<hi>Inveſtiture</hi> and preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them (ſo long as their canonical ſufficiency is not denyed by the Clergy) to ſuch Temporal Church-Poſſeſſions, as either Princes, or others by their permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have conferred on the Church (about which hath been in ancient times great Controverſy between ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kings of <hi>England</hi> and the Pope) I meddle not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. Let this, for the preſent, be granted as much as any Prince hath claimed. It is likewiſe conceded: that in thoſe words of the Oath <hi>[only Supreme Governor in Spiritual things]</hi> there is not any thing that expreſly extends the Regal Supremacy any further; which may be the only ſupreme power m Eccleſiaſticals in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and not in another. Nor no more is there in the thirty ſeventh Article of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which expounds the Kings Supremacy thus <hi>[That he is to rule all eſtates and degrees committed to his charge by God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48657:108"/>they be Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal, and to reſtrain with the Civil Sword the ſtubborn and evil-doers.]</hi> All which he may do; and yet be tyed in all things to obey the Church her Laws, and to leave to her the ſole judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>who are theſe evil-doers,</hi> as to the breaking of Gods Laws, or <hi>who stubborn and heretical</hi> perſons. And ſuch Regal Supremacy will well conſiſt with another; either with a domeſtick Supremacy of his own Clergy, in judging Controverſies and promulgating Laws in meerly Spirituals; or alſo with a forreign Supremacy and Juriſdiction, of a <hi>Patriarch</hi> over all the Biſhops of his Patriarchy in what Prince's Dominions ſoever; or of a General Council over all Provincial or National Churches. If therefore only ſuch a Regal Supremacy, as this, were intended in the Oath, it cannot be juſtly refuſed. <hi>viz.</hi> If the Oath ſhould run thus, — <hi>I do testify that the King is the Supreme</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as well in all Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes as Temporal</hi> [that is, (as this Supremacy is expounded in Article thirty ſeventh) <hi>to rule with the Civil Sword all eſtates and degrees committed to his charge by God, whether they be Eccleſiaſtical or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and to reſtrain with the Civil Sword the ſtubborn and evil-doers.</hi>] And if this word <hi>[ſuch]</hi> be inſerted in the words following: — And <hi>I do teſtify that no forreign Prince, Prelate</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>ought to have any</hi> [ſuch] <hi>juriſdiction</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Ergo I do utterly renounce all</hi> [ſuch] <hi>forreign Juriſdiction</hi> &amp;c. — You will ſay, what is gained to the King by an Oath ſo limited? This, that no Forreign or Domeſtick Power within his Dominions may, upon any pretence of Religion or other whatſoever, either take up himſelf, or licence any others to take up the Civil Sword againſt the King; or make any reſiſtance to him therewith in order to any perſon, or cauſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.

                        </note> to ſee what more might lye in them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. For the <hi>Firſt.</hi> There is a Supremacy in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, which the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate cannot juſtly claim; <hi>viz.</hi> Such Supremacies as theſe: that a Prince may, when a Superior Council abroad, or the major part of his Clergy at home, hath or doth determine againſt ſomething, which he, with ſome few, or a leſſer part, of his Clergy, is perſwaded to be conſonant to the word of God, may (I ſay) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and forbid the Doctrine of thoſe, and eſtabliſh and promulgate the Doctrine of theſe; may thus make and publiſh new Eccleſiaſtical Articles or Canons, and correct, ſuſpend, or diſpenſe with former, and that where no juſt pretence of their violating any way his Civil Government. That he, without any Synodal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his Clergy; or, He with it, againſt the decrees
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48657:109"/>of Superior Councils, may change the publick Church Liturgies, her Service, or Diſcipline; and that when theſe no way hurtful to the Civil State. That the Clergy may not aſſemble about Spiritual concernments (which none deny that they may do even under Heathen Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) but when he pleaſeth to call them; may teach or promulgate no Eccleſiaſtical Deciſions in matter of Doctrine, or Conſtitutions in matter of Diſcipline, to their flocks, being his Subjects, unleſs he firſt give his conſent unto them, tho theſe concern no civil right. That he may introduce into Biſhopricks whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, without the conſent of a major part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Epiſcopacy; or may diſplace any, or prohibite the function of their office, within his Dominions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any concurrence of the Clergy, and where is no juſt pretence of danger to his Secular Government. Briefly; to uſe Biſhops <hi>Carleton</hi>'s words cited before.
<q>That he may uſe any ſuch Spiritual Juriſdiction,<label type="milestone">

As hath been laid down in the firſt and ſecond <hi>Theſe;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">See before ſect;. 2.4.</note> and as will appear to any one at the firſt ſight, if he will but empty his fancy a little of the prime Patriarch of the Catholick Church his being <hi>Anti-Chriſt;</hi> and of an erroneous, and <hi>Superſtitious Hierarchy;</hi> and, on the other ſide, of an orthodox and godly <hi>Jeſias-Prince:</hi> and ſeriouſly conſider, what a miſchief it will bring upon a National Church, when the ſupreme Secular Magiſtrate thereof is an Heretick or Schiſmatick, and inveſted with the above-named Supremacies in Spiritual Affairs. Nay I may further add to theſe, that there is ſome Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, which the Proteſtants themſelves or the moſt Learned of them do not allow to the Prince: as this; That the Prince <hi>alone</hi> without the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48657:110"/>conſent of ſome of his Clergy may make or impoſe upon his Subjects Eccleſiaſtical Laws, or decide ſuch Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. And ſecondly there is another Supremacy which all the Presbyterian Proteſtants do not allow to the Prince: namely, that he may prohibite the Church Miniſtery and Officers from making or impoſing any Eccleſiaſtical: Law without his licence and conſent firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thereto; as you may ſee below §. 211.
<hi>[Meanwhile how both theſe do ſafely take this Oath (there being neither of theſe limitations by the Oath-impoſer mentioned either in it, or elſewhere with reference to it, nay the contrary being declared concerning the later of theſe two Supremacies) I ſee not, unleſs the Oath-taker may qualify his Oath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own ſenſe.]</hi> To require therefore ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Oath to ſuch Supremacies of the Civil Magiſtrate, as theſe now named, is not lawful.</p>

See before §. 71. All which authority formerly thus granted by the laws and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, the taker of this Oath is bound to aſſiſt and defend. (The like to which ſee alſo in the 1. and 2. <hi>Canon Eccleſiast.</hi> 1603.) Altho the former Clergy, under <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, had never annexed theſe Supremacies to the Crown.

72. And ſee himſelf, (if I miſtake him not) alſo defending ſuch Regal Supremacy, as is here affirmed to be claimed in the places quoted below, §. 205: and not only him, but many other learned Proteſtant Divines. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well might thoſe Biſhops underſtand the regal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in the Oath, in the ſame latitude, as theſe ſtill do allow and maintain it. But ſee Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> (<hi>Juſt Weights,</hi> 20. c) freely acknowledging what we have ſaid here, and deſiring therefore the abrogating of this, and the enacting of a new, Oath. —
<q>It is manifeſt (ſaith he) that not only the unlimited power of the Pope, but all authority of a General Council of the Weſtern Churches (whereof the Pope is and ought to be the chief Member) may juſtly ſeem to be diſclaimed, by other words of the ſame Oath; and that, whereas the Pope uſurped not only upon the Crown, but upon the Clergy of this Kingdome; all thoſe Uſurpations <hi>[as welt upon Clergy as King]</hi> are, by the Act of
<hi>reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> under <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. inveſted in the Crown. So that, when the Oath declares to maintain all Rights and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminences annexed to the Crown, you may underſtand that
<hi>maintenance</hi> which a Subject owes his Sovereign againſt thoſe that pretend to force his
<hi>[just]</hi> claim from Him; But you may alſo underſtand that <hi>mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> which a Divine owes the Truth in aſſerting the Title of the Crown to all Rights <hi>[whatever now]</hi> veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. Which <hi>[maintenance]</hi> he that believes that ſome Rights of the Church are inveſted in the Crown, ought not to undertake. — And again below: There is an appearance (ſaith he) that the miſ-underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Oath hath produced an opinion deſtructive to one Article of the Creed; <hi>[viz.]</hi> to the being of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48657:111"/>any <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> as Founded by God. And beſides it is not poſſible that all they, who are called to this Oath by Law, can ever be able to diſtinguiſh that ſenſe in which they ought, from that wherein they ought not, to take it. And therefore of neceſſity, the Law gives great offence; and that offence is the ſin of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and calls for Gods Vengeance upon it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is great reaſon, why, the Kingdome ſhould enact a new Oath <hi>&amp;c. Thus He.</hi>

                        <hi>And therefore I do utterly renounce all Forreign Juriſdictions</hi> &amp;c: You are firſt to note. That from what is ſaid before in the Oath
<hi>[that the Queens Highneſs is the only Supreme Governor in all Eccleſiaſtical things]</hi> it followeth; That ſo far as the Oath binds any to renounce all <hi>Forreign Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> or Authority, ſave the Queens, (that is, for any ſuch Juriſdiction in Spirituals, as the Queen claimeth, whether ſuch Juriſdiction be challenged by the Pope, or by a General Council <hi/> for here none is excepted) ſo far the Oath bindeth him alſo to renounce all <hi>Domestick Juriſdiction</hi> and Authority, (whether it be of the Arch-Biſhops, or Biſhops, or of a National Synod) in reſpect of, ſuch Juriſdiction as is claimed by the Prince. So that none, who holdeth any ſuch Juriſdiction in the Clergy at home, as others put in the Clergy or ſome Prelate abroad, may think that he eſcapeth the reach and power of the Oath, becauſe of the word <hi>[Forreign]</hi> inſerted therein. Having given you this pre-caution then, that you ſwear as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Juriſdiction of the Arch-Biſhop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> or the National Synod of this Church, as of the Pope, or of a General Council concerning the Juriſdiction that is challenged by the Prince: Now to conſider the thing it ſelf. There may be ſuch a Forreign or alſo Domeſtick Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy and Authority, as no way op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the good of the Civil State, nor any juſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Secular Prince; but rather much corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and fortifieth it: and again as mainly tendeth to the unity and peace of the Church; which thro all
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48657:111"/>the world is only one Corporation and Body. And ſuch Supremacy may be inſtituted and eſtabliſhed, either by our Saviour; or by his Apoſtles; or later Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Conſtitution: as the varying State of the Church may ſtem to require. Neither can an Authority, thus eſtabliſhed, and relating only to Spiritual Affairs, be juſtly diſturbed or annulled by any Secular Governor; neither Heathen (as is granted by all) nor Chriſtian (as there is more reaſon, that he, who is a Son and Subject of the Church, ſhould never do it) as hath been ſhe wed in <hi>Chur.

<q>It were a contradiction for the Church of <hi>England</hi> to pray for the Catholick Church and the unity thereof, and yet renounce the Juriſdiction of the whole Church, and the General Councils thereof, over it ſelf. King <hi>James</hi> acknowledgeth the Pope to be Patriarch of the

<q>A General Council, which is no ſtanding Court, but an aggregate body, compoſed partly of our ſelves [i. e. <hi>of the Prelates of the Church of England</hi>] is neither included here nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</q> General Councils then, it ſeems, of which the Engliſh Prelates are a part, have a Juriſdiction, over a particular Church, not ſubordinate to the Secular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors thereof. And if a General Council be once thus admitted, I ſee not how the Head thereof will be totally excluded; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> nor yet inferior Synods. Thirdly, There is a Supremacy in Spiritual matters, Deciſions, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees (I mean as to an independance on the Secular Power for the exerciſing their office, and enacting or divulging of ſuch Decrees) belonging to the
<hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> and their Provincial Synods in all National or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Churches; if the Firſt and Second <hi>Theſis</hi> above ſtand good.</p>

                        <q>The fourth Canon (ſaith he) of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> requireth, that all Biſhops be ordained by a Council of the Biſhops of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <hi>[ſifieri poteſt.]</hi> Which Council becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always be had; therefore it is provided <hi>[there]</hi> that two or three may do the work, the reſt conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and authorizing the proceeding. And this is that, which the ordinance of the Apoſtles hath provided, to keep the viſible Communion of the whole Church in unity.

That ſuch new ordained repairing to the Biſhop, and he finding them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſufficient ſhould ſupply that which was wanting to them in reſpect of their Orders,</hi> as they being before not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<hi>in very deed.</hi> And this is the Reaſon, why the Cardinal could not apply in this Inſtrument a preſent <hi>recipimus</hi> or <hi>diſpenſamus</hi> for theſe
<hi>Ordines,</hi> as he doth for other things; tho here he ingageth to make good to every one ſuch orders, as they then bare the title of. This is a ſence of which the Cardinals words are very capable, and ſeem alſo to favour; and which accords well with the Hiſtories of thoſe times: whereas that, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop puts upon them, makes them to contradict the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick actions and proceedings both before and after the paſſing of this act. For that the Cardinal, when Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Roman Biſhops held not the Orders received by the new Form ſufficiently valid <hi>quoad Characterem;</hi> as it may be gathered from Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s thirteenth Article forecited, and firſt conſidered, no doubt, by her Biſhops: ſo it is clear from the Biſhop of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> the Popes Legate his degrading
<hi>Ridley</hi> onely from his Presbyterſhip,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Fox p. 1604.</note> and not his Epiſcopacy: For, ſaith he, <hi>We do not acknowledge you for a Biſhop.</hi> Which had he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>quoad Excercitium,</hi> and not alſo <hi>quoad Characterem;</hi> then neither ſo ought he to have acknowledged him for, or degraded him as, a Presbyter; he being,
<hi>quoad excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citium,</hi>
                        <pb n="221" facs="tcp:48657:115"/>no more the one then the other. Now the reaſon why he acknowledged him no Biſhop <hi>quoad Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterem,</hi> was, I conceive, upon ſuppoſition that <hi>Ridley</hi> was not ordained by the old Form; becauſe much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence being taken at that old Form, we may conjecture by the reaſon given in the Preface of the Statute recited before §. 42. that alſo before the new ſet-form eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, there were in Ordinations ſome varyings from the old. The ſame you may ſee in <hi>Fox</hi> concerning <hi>Hooper</hi> made <hi>Prieſt</hi> by the old Form; <hi>Biſhop</hi> by the new: and therefore degraded in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days only as a Prieſt. Again Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> made Prieſt by the new Form: and therefore, in his condemnation not degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at all, but treated as a meer Laick.

Of which you have heard but now Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi>'s Teſtimony. Who, in the ſame place, applying his Doctrine to this very fact, goeth on thus;
<q>Now it is manifeſt, that the Ordinations, by which that Order <hi>[of Biſhops]</hi> is propagated in <hi>England</hi> at and ſince the Reformation, were not made by conſent of the greater part of Biſhops of each Province; but againſt their mind, tho they made no contrary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations. And by the ſame means it is manifeſt, that all thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Laws, by which the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> [i. e. <hi>by theſe new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>] were not made by a conſent capable to oblige the Church; if we ſet aſide the Secular power, that gave force unto that which was done <hi>[by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops]</hi> contrary to that rule, wherein the unity of the Church conſiſteth. But in other parts, the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was ſo far from being done by Biſhops and Presbyters, or any conſent, which was able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Church by the Conſtitution of the Church; that the very Order of Biſhops is laid aſide and forgot, if not worſe, <hi>i. e. deteſted,</hi> among them. Upon which precedent it ſounds plauſibly with the greateſt part among us; that, the unity of the whole being <hi>[thus]</hi> diſſolved by the Reformation [i. e. <hi>by the Reformers either being against Biſhops, or being Biſhops made against the conſent of the former Biſhops:</hi>] the unity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation cannot be preſerved, but by diſſolving the Order of Biſhops among us.

What? That which the Clergy tell him to be the truth? <hi>No.</hi> But only that, in which he findeth them to judge aright and according to the Scriptures; which judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he may entertain, tho it be a ſmaller part of the Clergy that judge ſo. Here therefore the King judgeth, when, or which of the Clergy judgeth aright, and which otherwiſe: and is at his liberty, to follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any number of them. And neither is he thus a Judge for himſelf-only, <hi>judicio diſcretivo,</hi> as they call it; but for others too, <hi>judicio deciſivo</hi> (which the Clergy are not) ſo far, as to promulgate and command all his Subjects, and amongſt them the Clergy, to obey that which he, upon conſulting the Clergy and hearing their reaſons, judgeth to be according to Gods word: and this without the conſent of the Clergy at all; or at leaſt of the major part of them. But they may not promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate what they judge according to Gods word in ſuch Controverſies without the Kings conſent. And yet <hi>quis enim noſtrum unquam affirmavit, Principes in cauſis fidei &amp; religionis ſupremos eſſe cognitores &amp; judices?</hi> I would fain ſpeak it plainly, if I could. A Controverſy is agitated in Religion; the King conſulteth his Clergy about it; they give him their reaſons, why ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is agreeable to the Scriptures. He conſiders the Scriptures and their reaſons, and judgeth, upon it, that their reaſons are faulty; and that they define not <hi>juxta legem </hi> and that the contradictory Propoſition, which perhaps ſome few of the Clergy compared with
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48657:121"/>the reſt, or perhaps none of them maintain, is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture. Whereupon he publiſheth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Propoſition to all his Subjects, Clergy as well as Laity, by his edicts; and requireth their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereto. Is not the Prince then a Judge of ſuch Controverſy, as well as, nay rather than, the other, and over, and after, the other? Commanding obedience to him from the other? 'Tis true: that Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> and others acknowledge in matters of Religion no viſible judge on earth, that is infallible. But he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Judge, <hi>judicio diſcretivo</hi> for himſelf; and this is every private man. Again he acknowledgeth a Supreme viſible publick Judge on earth, <hi>judicio deciſivo;</hi> ſo far as to command ſuch a Doctrine to be received by all his Subjects Eccleſiaſtical and Laick for a truth, which he, by his <hi>judicium diſcretionis,</hi> holds to be ſo. And this is every Chriſtian Prince within his own Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48657:123"/>this Subject, to ſpeak out plainly concerning this branch of Supremacy;
<hi>Whether the Prince may reform any thing in matters of Faith againſt</hi> the major part of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors or againſt <hi>Synods:</hi> Yet is this the chief point of Supremacy which ſuſtaineth the Engliſh Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Amongſt all the parts of the Regal <hi>Primacy,</hi> which he reckoneth up p. 373. and again p. 380, 381. againſt <hi>Tortus,</hi> this is not, that I can diſcern at all, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſpoken to. He ſaith indeed p. 380. <hi>Regi jus nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum eſſe vel fidei novos articulos, vel cultus divini novas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulas procudendi.</hi> But here
<hi>novos</hi> may be oppoſed either to the former decrees of the Synods and Councils of the Church; or only to the Scriptures; and he may mean the later. Again, p. 365. to <hi>Tortus</hi> ſaying; <hi>Regi ex officio incumbere, ut qui in doctrinâ ſunt abuſus &amp; corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telas tollat; ſed poſt eccleſiae declarationem:</hi> he anſwers; <hi>Nos vero citra declarationem omnem, ubi repurgatae ſunt corruptelae per Reges, docemus.</hi> Where you may obſerve this ſtill left in doubt: Whether <hi>Rex contra declarationem</hi> &amp;c. may do ſuch things; and yet, if the King be bound to conſult the Church firſt in ſuch matters, according to <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.8, his reforming will ſtill be either <hi>ſecundum;</hi> or
<hi>contra;</hi> and not <hi>citra</hi> only. Neither is it credible, but that both
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> &amp;c. conſulted with the Prieſts in their Reformation. Again, p. 369. he ſaith: <hi>Authoritate Rex propriâ reſecare poteſt ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes quas ſacerdotes ipſi tolerant;</hi> but he ſaith not; <hi>quas ſacerdotes ipſi docent nen eſſe ſuperstitiones.</hi> Again, p. 364. he ſpeaks thus of a thing done. <hi>In</hi> Iſraele <hi>praecipuae in re religionis partes penes Regem extiterunt; vel uno hoc argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento, quod per ſacrae historiae ſeriem totam mutato novi regis animo mutata ſemper eſt facies religionis.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48657:123"/>Governors may do nothing <hi>contra Regis mandatum;</hi> nor may oppoſe him and teach the people contrary to his Reformations; where they judge that he reformeth not aright (what did the Church-Governors for the firſt 300 years?) Eſpecially ſince p. 377. (which I deſire you much to mark) he alloweth ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy as the good Kings of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> uſed, not to all, but only to Chriſtian, Princes; and to Chriſtian Princes, not all, but only <hi>thoſe not heretical;</hi> and I ſuppoſe he would ſay alſo, not ſchiſmatical (for if the Prince were heretical or ſchiſmatical he well ſaw the miſchief of ſuch a power) ſo he ſaith there. <hi>Interim autem ſit vel infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> [Princeps]

And ſomething toward this ſaith Mr. <hi>Maſon, de Miniſt.</hi> 3. l. 5. c. if I rightly underſtand him. <hi>Regibus, qui vel non ſunt chriſtiani; vel ſi chriſtiani, non tamen orthodoxi; vel ſi orthodoxi, non tamen ſancti, prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus competit quidem, ſed</hi> ſecundum quid: i. e. <hi>quoad au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem, non quoad rectum &amp; plenum uſum authoritatis; quoad officium, non quoad illuſtrem executionem officii</hi> [none ſuch therefore may execute any Eccleſiaſtical Primate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, unleſs the Author ſeek for ſome refuge in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets <hi>rectus, plenus, &amp; illuſtris.</hi>] And the ſame ſaith Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Bicſon.</hi>
                        <q>When the Magiſtrate doth not regard, but rather afflict the Church, as in times of

                        <hi>[To which queſtion he anſwers]</hi> The Metropolitan. Now if no Prince heretical, tho Chriſtian, hath any Primacy in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs; before we yield ſuch Primacy to a Prince, we muſt know, whether he be not hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and who can ſo rightly judge of this, as the Church or Clergy? And then, will not the Church (and is it not right to,) judge him ſuch, when he oppoſeth her preſent or former definitions in matters of Faith? See

And what juſt Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, then, for matter of Doctrine, is left here to the Prince, but an authorizing by his coactive power the Church's decrees?

But, as I ſaid, this is contrary to what Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> ſaith elſewhere; that the Princes Supremacy may oppoſe the Clergy, when they do (<hi>i. e.</hi> when he thinks they do) <hi>recedere de viâ, &amp; non docere juxta le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem Dei</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<hi>§. 188.</hi>
                        </note> was a Law ordained by the Apoſtles: and That the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation made in <hi>England</hi> had plainly violated this Law, in that the new Biſhops that were introduced were made without and againſt the conſent of the former (ſome of his words are cited before §. 200.) taketh this courſe to ſolve this difficulty, and to preſerve the Engliſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, notwithſtanding this, from being unlawful or ſchiſmatical.
<q>To come then (ſaith he) to the great difficulty propoſed: it is to be acknowledged, that the power of the Church, in the perſons of them to whom it is derived by continual Succeſſion, is a Law ordained by the Apoſtles, for the unity of the Church <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But withal it is to be acknowledged, that there are abundance of other Laws given the Church by our Lord and his Apoſtles, whether they concern matters of Faith; or matter of Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which proceeding from the ſame, if not a greater, power, than the Succeſſion of the Church, are to be retained all, and every one of them with the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and conſcience <hi>[as the ſucceſſion of the Church.]</hi> Again, I have ſhewed indeed, that the ſecular power
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48657:124"/>is bound to protect the Eccleſiaſtical, in their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining all things which are not <hi>[otherwiſe]</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by our Lord and his Apoſtles; and to give force and effect to the acts of the ſame. But in matters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready determined by our Lord and his Apoſtles, as Laws given to the Church, if by injury of time the practice become contrary to the Law; the Sovereign power, being bound to protect Chriſtianity, is bound to employ it ſelf in giving ſtrength, firſt, to that which is ordained by our Lord and his Apoſtles. By conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if thoſe, with whom the power of the Church is truſted, ſhall hinder the reſtoring of ſuch Laws; the Sovereign power may and ought, by way of penalty to ſuch perſons, to ſuppreſs their power; that ſo it may be committed to ſuch as are willing to ſubmit to the ſuperior Ordinance of our Lord and his Apoſtles.</q> Here Mr.
<hi>Thorndike</hi> holds, that <hi>the Secular power may reſtore any law, which Chriſt or his Apoſtles have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi> not only againſt a major part, but all, the Clergy, and Governors of the Church: and <hi>may,</hi> for a penalty of their oppoſing it, <hi>ſuppreſs their power and commit it to others,</hi> tho they alſo be eſtabliſhed by another Law Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>204</label> But to ſay ſomething to this diſcourſe of his. What reaſonable man is there hearing this, that will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ask: <hi>Who ſhall judge, whether that be indeed a Law ordained by our Lord or his Apoſtles, which the Prince would introduce or reſtore, and the ſucceſſion of the Clergy doth oppoſe?</hi> Which Clergy ſure will never confeſs ſuch to be a law of our Lord, but always will profeſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: nay will ſay, that the ſucceſſion of the Clergy ſhall keep, teach, and maintain, our Lord's laws to the end of the world? This queſtion he asketh not; he ſolveth not; as writing againſt the Presbyterians, who will not ask it him. But what can he ſay? Shall the Clergy judge? They deny it to be the Lord's law, what he, againſt their conſent, would reſtore. Shall the Prince judge? But this is moſt unreaſonable, that the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Laick ſhall be preferred before the whole ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48657:125"/>of the Clergy in Spiritual manters. And what miſchief will come hereupon, if he judge amiſs? And here let me ſet before him his own rules: <hi>Right of Chur.</hi> 4. c. p. 235.
<q>Such a difference falling out [ſaith he, i. e. <hi>between the ſecular power and the Biſhops</hi>] ſo that to particular perſons it cannot be clear, who is in the right</q>
                        <hi>[as how can it be clear to particular perſons, which is not to their guides in thoſe matters; and which is not to other particular perſons, who alſo think the contrary clear?]</hi>
                        <q>it will be requiſite for Chriſtians, in a doubtful caſe, at their utmoſt perils, to adhere to the guides of the Church, againſt their lawful Sovereigns.</q> But, if this his anſwer, that <hi>the Prince may ſuppreſs the Apostolical power of the Clergy, when this goeth againſt other our Lords or the Apostles Laws,</hi> be unſatisfying to the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty he propoſeth, I know not what other can poſſibly be returned to that his objection. And I wonder that this conſiderative man, who holds not the Pope to be Anti-Chriſt, or the Hierarchy of the Church to be the followers of Anti-Chriſt, ſhould make ſuch a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as this:
<hi>that the Apoſtolical Succeſſion of the Clergy ſhould oppoſe our Lords or the Apoſtles laws, ſo far, as that we ſhall depend on the Laity to reſtore them, and to protect Christianity against their Guides.</hi>

                        <q>It is true (ſaith he) the Clergy in their Convocation can do nothing now, but as their doings are confirmed by the Kings authority. And I conclude; it ſtands

Which was
<hi>Philpot</hi>'s Plea recited before, §. 168. contrary to the Second <hi>Theſis.</hi>
                        <q>The Kings of <hi>England</hi> (ſaith he) had a further right as to this particular; which is a power conferred upon them by the Clergy (whether by way of recognition, or conceſſion, I regard not here) by which the Clergy did inveſt the King with a ſupreme authority, not only of confirming their Synodal Acts not to be put in execution without his conſent, but in effect to devolve on him all that power which firmly they enjoyed in their own capacity</q> [<hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which Powers</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 85.) <hi>he nameth this,</hi> To reform ſuch Errors and Corruptions, as are expreſly contrary to the word of God]
<q>And to this we have a parallel caſe in the Roman Empire; in which the ſupreme Majeſty of the State was veſted in the Senate and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome,</hi> till by the Law, which they called <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> they transferred all their power on <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the following Emperors. Which Law being paſſed, the Edicts of the Emperor were as binding, as the
<hi>Senatus-conſulta</hi> had been before. Whence came that memorable Maxime in <hi>Juſtinians Inſtitutes, Quod Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi placuerit, legis habet vigorem.</hi> The like may be affirmed of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The Clergy had ſelf authority in all matters which concerned Religion;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48657:126"/>and by their Canons and Determinations did bind all the Subjects; till by acknowledging King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth for the Supreme Head, and by the Act of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion not long after following, they transferred that power upon the King and his Succeſſors. After which time <hi>whatſoever</hi> the King or his Succeſſors did in the Reformation, as it had virtually the power of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; ſo was it as good in law, as if the Clergy in their Convocation particularly and <hi>in terminis</hi> had agreed upon it. And tho in moſt of their proceedings toward Reformation the Kings adviſed with ſuch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as they had about them, or could aſſemble with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble; yet was there no neceſſity, that all or the greateſt part of the Biſhops ſhould be drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that purpoſe, no more than it was anciently for the godly Emperors to call together the moſt part of the Biſhops in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the matters which concerned the Church; or for the godly Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> to call together the greateſt part of the Prieſts and Levites, before they acted any thing in the Reformation of thoſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and abuſes, which were crept in amongſt them.</q> Thus Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> p. 84.</p>

                        <q>That, whereas Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be, firſt, in corruption of manners or abuſes in Government; ſecondly, in matters practical; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in points of Doctrine; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Firſt, That if the things to be reformed be either corruptions in manners, or neglect of publick duties to Almighty God; be abuſes either in Government, or in the parties governing; the King may reform this himſelf by his ſole authority, tho the whole body of the Clergy or the greateſt part thereof ſhould oppoſe him in it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. That if the practice prove to have been both ancient and univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived over all the Church; the King conſulting with
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48657:126"/>ſo many of his Biſhops and others of his moſt able Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy as he thinks fit to call unto him, and having their conſent and direction in it, may in caſe of intermiſſion or corruption, reſtore ſuch practice to its primitive luſtre <hi>[tho he do it againſt the major part of his Clergy or Synod, as you may ſee,</hi> p. 83.]</q> 3. He intimates; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> That if the Reformation be in ſuch point of Doctrine, as hath been before defined in a General Council or in particular Councils univerſally received and countenanced; the King conſulting with ſome of his learned Biſhops may enjoyn it without or againſt a Synod. 4. But he ſaith:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                        <q>That if the Reformation be in ſuch points of Doctrine, as have not been before defined in ſuch manner; the King, only with a few of his Biſhops and Learned Clergy tho never ſo well ſtudied in the point diſputed, can do nothing in it. That belongs only to the whole body of the Clergy in their Convocation rightly called and conſtituted. So he ſaith, p. 85. That the King cannot determine Hereſies.</q>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> From this by neceſſary conſequence it follows: That <hi>if any point of doctrine hath been determined by a former General Council</hi> (I add, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſuperior Council) the King neither againſt, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, (I add, nor with)

Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two laſt, I leave it to your judgment, whether, in the inſtances made above, the contrary to ſeveral doctrines determined by former lawful General, or other ſuperior, Councils, have not been eſtabliſhed by our reforming Princes, without, or alſo againſt, the major part of their Clergy. And again; whether other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines not determined by any former lawful Council, yet have not thus alſo, without any ſuch conſent, been eſtabliſhed by them. Both which Dr.
<hi>Heylin</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Again, concerning all theſe limitations, I ask; when all or the major part of Clergy affirmeth, that ſuch things are not corruptions in manners, nor abuſes in Government; that ſuch practices are not primitive, nor univerſal; that ſuch doctrines are not formerly ſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48657:127"/>and none or a ſmaller part of the ſaid Clergy ſaith the contrary: How will Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> here direct the Kings Supremacy? Will he here allow him, after hearing all, to follow his own judgment? Or that of the fewer againſt his Synod, or the major part thereof? It ſeems in ſome things he will not allow it; (See <hi>Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> the fourth) and it ſeemeth unreaſonable to be allowed in any of the reſt. For why ſhould not a Synod diſcern corruption in manners, as well as he, or ſome few?

<q>The Proteſtants of <hi>Germany</hi> (ſaith he) would not allow the King's Supremacy, leſt they ſhould infer an inveſting of the ſame authority in the Emperor, whoſe abſolute power they ſeemed to fear, more, than that of the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

Firſt it ſeemeth clear: That in Controverſies of Religion (which Chriſt hath foretold ſhall ariſe) and in conteſts concerning the true ſenſe of his word, he hath not left his people under the Goſpel without ſome viſible Judge thereof, beſide the words of the Goſpel; ſince he did not leave his people under the Law without ſuch Judge, beſide the words of the Law. See what hath been ſaid of this in <hi>Succeſſ. of Clergy,</hi> §. 6. &amp;c. And, in ſuch Controverſies concerning the meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for any party to fly only to the ſame Scriptures to judge this matter between them and their adverſaries, is, as if <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Sempronius,</hi> ſuing one another at the Law, would have no other judge in the matter, but <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s <hi>Code</hi> or
<hi>Pandects,</hi> about the meaning of which they are already in the debate. 2. But, if it ſeem reaſonable, that, in ſuch Controverſy concerning the underſtanding of Scripture, there ſhould be ſome other Judge beſides Scripture; ſecondly it is out of queſtion, that the Church Catholick, which hath ſuch ample promiſes from our Saviour, ſhould be this Judge ſooner, than any particular perſon or Church therein: and, if the Church Catholick, then a legal General Council thereof; ſince this is the higheſt and ultimate way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48657:133"/>the Church Catholick is capable of declaring her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as hath been ſhewed in the 2. Part, §. 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Hence therefore <hi>3ly</hi> are the Reformed forced, as it were, in their debates of Religion to refer their matters to, and not to decline, the deciſive judgment of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture legal and free General Council. 4. But this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by conſequence to oblige them ſomewhat further; and that in this their appeal to, and acquieſcence in, a future General Council, they cannot reaſonably refuſe the judgment of ſuch Councils fore-paſt, as have been legally General. 5. And again <hi>5ly</hi> that, to denominate any former Councils to have been ſuch, they cannot rationally require any fuller conditions, than have been ſet down in 2. Part, §. 4. unleſs they will make either no Councils at all; or not all thoſe, which themſelves allow, to have been General. And
<hi>6ly</hi> if they will thus ſtand to the judgment of former legal General Councils; then it ſeems they ought alſo to ſtand to the doctrines, which are cleared to them to be held and taught by the Church Catholick of that age, wherein they reformed: ſince we may preſume, that had a Council thereof been collected in the ſame times; they would in it have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ſame doctrines, which the Catholick Church then held., But thus the Reformation will be caſt; ſince I think it is ſufficiently cleared in 2. Part, §. 30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the doctrines they oppoſed, at leaſt for the moſt of them, were not only the Tenents of the Roman or other. Churches adhering to it, but of the whole Church Catholick of that time: a thing which is of great weight, and ought diligently to be examined. And, <hi>7ly,</hi> if they will ſubmit to a General Council; I do not ſee how, in the abſenee of a General, their duty doth not bind them to ſubmit alſo to a Patriarchal, Council; as being, tho inferior to General, yet ſuperior to any Provincial, or National, one, within the ſame Patriarchy. And, if ſubmit to ſuch; I ſee not why they ſhould reject the judgment of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as to the Proteſtant Controverſies free and unforced: there needing to be uſed no illegal or indirect proceedings herein; becauſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48657:134"/>the Fathers, in condemning theſe, did unanimouſly agree; as hath been ſhewed at large in Par. 4. §. 70. by <hi>Soave</hi>'s teſtimony in particular to theſe points.</p>

As namely theſe following. 1. That, for the Councils which have been held already in the Church, they have ſo limited the obligation to their authority, and clogged it with ſuch conditions (which you may be pleaſed to review in 2. Par. §. 36, 37. <hi>&amp;c:</hi>) that, in reſpect of theſe, they have reſerved to themſelves liberty to yield, or withdraw, their obedience, as they ſee fit. From which we may gather, that, if they ſee need thereof, they will in like manner limit the future, and ſo render it as unobliging to them, as former have been. 2. That they have been ſo ſcrupulous about the <hi>Univerſality, legal actings,</hi> &amp;c. of paſt Councils beyond what ſeems requiſite (See 2. Par. §. 4.) that, of eighteen or not much fewer, General Councils, which the other ſide accepts, they acknowledge only four or very few more: and not theſe four for all thoſe decrees, wherein the reſt of the Church admits them. See 4. Par. §. 92.95. 3. That they maintain, that, tho all the Church-guides never ſhall, yet the major part of the Church guides and of ſuch Councils may, dangerouſly err, to the impoſing of falſe belief and falſe worſhip, and <hi>pars melior a majore vinci.</hi> See 2. Part, §.
29. Which tenent will overthrow the authority of ſuch future Council alſo; becauſe it can hardly happen in ſo great n Body, but that there
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48657:134"/>will be ſome diſſenters; and then they will not be tyed to a major part. 4. That, for a future Council they demand ſuch a one, for the univerſality of it, as probably can never be had: and ſuch voters therein, as is contrary to the former cuſtomes of the Church, and ſuch other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as are ſeveral ways unreaſonable, and deſtructive of having Church-matters governed by the Church. See, concerning theſe, the 4. Part, §. 65,
66. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho, were all ſuch their conditions obſerved, excepting only one, <hi>that nothing done in ſuch Council ſhould oblige, till their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent firſt obtained,</hi> I ſee not, but that things will thus alſo go againſt them becauſe as the major part of the Clergy of Chriſtianity, ſo of the Laity and Princes, were they made the Judges in that Council, are oppoſite to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. 5. That they do ſet up the authority of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial or National Synods, in ſome caſes,<note place="margin">

5th Part ſtand good, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pleaded for it. Now all theſe guards and fences of the Reformed ſeem to me to render a future Council, were it never ſo univerſal and free, of none effect, as to ending Controverſies; unleſs it paſs on their ſide: and again ſeem to argue an
<hi>Autocatacriſis</hi> in them, as to the judgment of the Church Catholick, and of Councils;
<hi>viz. that they apprehend, they ſhould be caſt by thoſe, whom yet they ſhew a willingneſs to be tryed by.</hi> Eſpecially when as, after now an 140 years divulging of their doctrines, their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and their demonſtrations; they ſee, that, tho at the firſt (perhaps out of novelty) their opinions made a wonderful progreſs and growth: yet, for above half of this age, the Reformation hath ſtood at a ſtay; and of late hath rather loſt ground, and is grown decrepit and much abated of its former bulk and ſtature.</p>

Which whoſoever doth, tho perchance he wanteth not many companions, had need to be ſure, and ſure again, that he is in the right: becauſe this thing, in the day of judgment, will hinder all thoſe, that err, from pleading invincible or inculpable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, when as they do grant, both that God hath given them, beſide the Scriptures, guides of their Faith; and that they have in their judgment departed from theſe guides, <hi>i. e,</hi> from a major part of them; which, in a Court conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many, is the legal Judge.

Namely ſuch, as Chriſtianity hath <hi>de novo,</hi> by our Saviours authority and commiſſion, introduced into the world, and into the ſeveral Civil States thereof, which do voluntarily ſubject themſelves unto its laws: and ſuch, as the Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, our Saviours Subſtitutes from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, have lawfully exerciſed in ſeveral Princes dominions, when the ſame Princes
<pb facs="tcp:48657:136"/>have prohibited them the exerciſe of ſuch things under pain of death. Which things you may ſee numbred by Biſhop <hi>Carleton</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low § <hi>3.</hi> or by Dr.
<hi>Taylor,</hi> or by the Kings Paper, <hi>Ibid. 2.</hi> That there is nothing aſſerted here concerning the lawfulneſs of any Spiritual power's uſing, or authorizing any others to uſe, the material or temporal Sword in any caſe or neceſſity whatſoever; tho it were in
<hi>ordine ad Spiritualia. 3.</hi> That I know not of any Eccleſiaſtical powers in this Diſcourſe denyed to the Prince, but which (or at leaſt the chiefeſt of which) all other Chriſtian Princes, except thoſe of the reformed States, do forego to exerciſe; and do leave to the management of the Clergy; and yet their Crowns, notwithſtanding the relinquiſhing this power in Spirituals, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, proſper, flouriſh: And not any, but which the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> have alſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. Now; no more Supremacy in ſuch Eccleſiaſtical matters, as are delegated by Chriſt to the Clergy, and are unalienable by them to any Secular power, can belong to the Princes of one Time, or of one Nation, than do to any other Prince of a former Time, or a diverſe
<pb facs="tcp:48657:136"/>Nation; Becauſe what are thus the Church's Rights, no Civil or Municipal law of any Kingdome, in any time, can lawfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, diminiſh, or alter; Nor may any ſuch Secular laws, made, be urged as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical for ſhewing what are, or are not, the Church's Rights. And therefore in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the foreſaid Clergy-Rights the Kings of <hi>England</hi> can have no more priviledge or exemption, than the King of <hi>France;</hi> nor, in <hi>England, Henry</hi> the Eighth, than <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh; Nor can any perſon, in maintaining the Church's foreſaid Rights, be any more now a diſloyal Subject to his Prince in theſe, than he would have been in thoſe, days.</p>

They are extorted by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of thoſe Adverſaries, who have endeavour'd to wound us in all our neareſt concerns, The Honour of our Univerſity, the Autority of our Church, and the Rights of our Sovereign. The <hi>Laborious Author</hi> of the

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S that Perſon, who would prove himſelf a genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Son of the Church of England, had need of more Sincerity then this Editor ſhew'd, whilſt He profeſt to be of Her Communion; ſo one, who has the ambition of appearing a potent Enemy againſt her, had need of greater Strength then he has either produc'd of his own, or borrow'd from others, ſince he has been her declar'd Adverſary. Had he continued ſtill to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his Faith, and affected an aequilibrium betwixt both Churches, His writings would have been more ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſuch a Character; where the attentive Reader will find the Church of England but weakly attacq'd, and that of Rome as faintly vindicated. But ſince ſome Motives have prevail'd with him to aſſume the Name of another Church, as that which he has left has no great cauſe to lament the loſs of ſuch a Member, ſo that which He would ſeem to have fled to will have little reaſon to boaſt that She has gain'd a Proſelyte. For how plauſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever He may diſcourſe of Church-Autority, He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in too great a <hi>Plerophory</hi> of his own ſenſe, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf either to a Convocation at home, or Council abroad; and altho' he would appear an Enemy to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> he ſeems at this very time to be drawing up a novell Scheme of Doctrines, and modelling to himſelf a new Church.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that in one of his Treatiſes he has deſerted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48657:141"/>the antient Plea of Tranſubſtantiation, upon which the Tridentine Fathers founded their Adoration of the Hoſt; and from which all the great Champions of that Church have conſtantly deduc'd it. Hence his modifying the Council's <hi>Sacramentum</hi> into <hi>Res Sacramenti,</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinding from the Symbols, his certain inferior <hi>cult</hi> only due to them, his ſtripping them even of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens <hi>latricall, qualified, ſecondary, improper, accidental co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adoration;</hi> and ſuch other his abſtractive Notions of that Worſhip, as do indeed befit a <hi>Nominal</hi> Philoſopher, but have no agreement with the avowed doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of the Roman Communion. Hence it is that in the Diſcourſe we are now upon, We read nothing of the <hi>Dominus Deus Papa</hi> of the Canoniſts; Nothing of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Chriſt; the Holy, Apoſtolick, and Infallible See which their former Writers have endeavour'd to eſtabliſh <hi>Jure divino;</hi> Nothing of the Supreme Paſtour, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Head of Chriſt's Church, the Succeſſor of S. Peter, and other Titles which even our Repreſenters of late (whoſe buſineſs it hath been to mollifie) have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd us with; No not ſo much as of the <hi>modeſt Biſhop of Meaux's</hi> Primacy of S. Peter's chair and common Center of Catholic Unity; but inſtead of theſe we are told of a <hi>Weſtern Patriarch,</hi> one who pleads the Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Years for his Autority, and thinks himſelf hardly dealt with,<note place="margin">pag. 214.</note> that becauſe He claims more then his due, that which is his due ſhould be denyed him. Hence it ſeems to be that He is ſo wary in giving us his own Opinions; that He diſputes ſo much, and affirms ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; that he bounds all his Poſitions with ſo many limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that they ſeem contriv'd on purpoſe for ſubterfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and that He very cautiouſly ventures not any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then He thinks, tho' falſly, the Autority of our Writers will bear him out. Hence thoſe Conceſſions

That the publick Communion was then moſt commonly, if not allways, adminiſtred in both kinds unto the People. That the Divine Service which then, as now, was celebrated uſually in the Latin or Greek Tongue, was much better in thoſe days then now underſtood of the Common people. That the having the Liturgy, or Divine Service, or the Holy Scriptures in a known tongue is not prohibited, nor the uſing of Images enjoyn'd; nor the Prieſt's admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring, and the people's receiving the Communion in both kinds, if the Supreme Church-Governours ſo think fit (and we ſay they ill diſcharge the Office of Church-Governours, who do not <hi>think fit</hi> our Saviours Inſtitution ſhould be obſerv'd) declar'd unlawful by any Canon of any Council.</q> Ancient Council he means, for latter Councils have declar'd theſe unlawful. Theſe are large grants from a <hi>Romanist,</hi> and which give a great ſhock to their ſo much magnified pretence of Univerſal Tradition. Had this Author liv'd in thoſe Ages when the Secular Prince countenanc'd the beginnings of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, He would have ſcarce loſt any thing for his too rigorous adhaeſion to the C. of Rome. For he thinks it probable
<q>that had the Reformation only tranſlated the former Church Liturgies and Scriptures into a known tongue; <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>118</label> adminiſtred Communion in both kinds, thought fit not to uſe Images; changed ſomething of practiſe only without any deceſſion from the Churches Doctrines, the Church-Governours would have been facile to licenſe theſe.</q> Where by the way it ſeems ſomething unintelligible how they ſhould <hi>change practice</hi> without
<hi>deceſſion</hi> from <hi>Doctrines,</hi> if Doctrines enjoyn'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48657:142"/>ſuch Practices,<note place="margin">pag. 2. §. 2.</note> and if according to him, <hi>Errours in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice allways preſuppoſe ſome Errour in matter of Faith.</hi> But at leaſt we may expect He would have <hi>outwardly</hi> complied, ſince he notes,
<q>That ſome outward compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the firſt,<note place="margin">pag. 140. §. 123.</note> of thoſe Biſhops, who made an open Oppoſition afterward, might be upon a fair Pretence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt Acts of the Reformation might not be ſo inſupportable as the latter.</q> Where it is worth our Obſerving, that the very firſt Act, which gave life to the Reformation, was ſhaking off all manner of Obedience to the See of Rome, then which I believe his Holineſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Author's Sentiments, thinks no Act more unſupportable.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſider'd, We could not have had a more eaſie Adverſary then this Gentleman, and the Church has leſs reaſon to fear his open Oppoſition, then had he ſtill continued in her boſom. For it ſeems not to be his Province to publiſh what is Material againſt us, but to publiſh Much. But, God be thanked, our Religion is not eſtabliſh'd upon ſo weak a baſis, as to be overthrown by a few Theſes unprov'd, and falſly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor is it any wonder if that arguer doth not convince, who uſes for Principles Concluſions drawn from Praemiſſes, which the world never ſaw, and then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes ſuch things as every one acquainted with Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is able to contradict. Certainly his Univerſity-Readers will not be very fond of the Concluſion of that Syllogiſm, whoſe Major is a <hi>petitio principii,</hi> &amp; Minor a down-right falſ-hood in matter of fact. They no doubt are ſurpriz'd to find Conſequents come before their Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, and Church-Government part the 5th to have ſtept into the World (ſomewhat immaturely methinks) before the other four. But the Lawfulneſs of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Reformation was to be examin'd, and it would have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48657:142"/>took up too much time to ſhew why he impos'd upon us ſuch a Teſt.</p>
                  <p>It might therefore be thought ſeaſonable enough to examin the Truth of his Theſes, when he ſhall be pleas'd to communicate to us whence they are inferr'd. In the meanwhile, it may not be unuſeful to conſider what diſſervice he had done to our Cauſe, had his ſucceſs aequal'd the boldneſs of his attempt. After all his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and their Applications, his Correſpondent Alpha's and Beta's, his perplex'd Paragraphs, his intricate Parathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and his taedious Citations, what Doctrine of the Church of Rome has he eſtabliſh'd, or what principle of Ours has he diſprov'd? Should we grant that the Clergy only have power in Controverſies of Religion, that the Secular Prince has no Autority to reform Errours in the Church, that our Princes did wrongfully uſurp ſuch an Autority, and that our Reformation was not the act of the Clergy; will it hence follow (which yet is to be prov'd by this Author, e're he can perſwade us to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any favourable Opinion of Popery) That the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment ought to be expung'd out of the Decalogue? that Idolatry is no Sin? or worſhipping of Images no Idolatry? that Tranſubſtantiation is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd in deſpight of Senſe, Reaſon, Scripture, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity? the Service of God to be adminiſtred in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, as it were in mere contradiction to Saint Paul? and the Communion to be celebrated in one kind notwithſtanding our Saviours, <hi>Drink ye all of this.</hi> It is indeed our happineſs, that the Reformation was carried on by the joynt concurrence of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical power; that We are united together by common Rules for Government and Worſhip agree'd on by the Biſhops and Presbyters in Convocation, and made Laws to us by the Autority of the Sovereign:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48657:143"/>We are allways ready to prove that the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land being a National Church, and not Subject to any forreign Juriſdiction, ow'd no Obedience to the Biſhop or Church of Rome, &amp; therefore might without their leave reform her ſelf, and that accordingly our Religion is eſtabliſh'd by ſuch Laws as want no autority either Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Eccleſiaſtical, which they ought to have. This is a Plea which we ſhall be allways prepar'd to juſtifie; and a Bleſſing for which we thank God, and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of which we ſhall never ceaſe to pray. But now had thoſe which we eſteem corruptions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church never been caſt out, or were they reeſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd (which God in his mercy forbid) by as good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority as that by which they are now aboliſh'd; Yet even then we could not ſubmit to ſuch Determinations, and being concluded by an antecedent Obligation to God durſt not obey even lawful autority commanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful things. He therefore that would gain a Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte, who acts upon prudent and Conſcientious principles, in vain entertains him with Schemes of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince the things conteſted are ſuch as no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world can make lawful; It would be more rational to ſhew (were not that an attempt long ſince deſpair'd of) that the particular doctrines and practiſes to which we are invited, are agreeable to the word of God; or that it doth not concern us, whether they be, or not. For if either it may be prov'd, that the Errours of the Church of Rome were ſo great, that there was a neceſſity of reforming them, that every National Church has a right to reform her ſelf, that this right of the Church of England in particular was unqueſtionable, that ſhe us'd no other then this her lawful right, and that accordingly the Reformation was effected by the Major part of the then legal Church-Governours: Or if in fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48657:143"/>of this (which yet we ſay is far from being our caſe) it may be prov'd, that where evident Neceſſity requires, and the prevailing Errours are manifeſt, there the Civil power may lawfully reform Religion without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the major part of the Clergy, for Secular Intereſts averſe from Reformation; Or if laſtly, ſuppoſing no ſuch Reformation made by lawful authority, but the Laws which enjoyn ſuch erroneous Doctrines, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their full force and vigour, every private Chriſtian can plead an Exemption from his Obedience to them, by proving them evidently contradictory to the known laws of God; if any one of theſe Pleas are valid, all which have by our Writers been prov'd to be ſo beyond the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of a fair Reply, then Nothing which is aim'd at in theſe Papers can affect us, and tho' the author would have ſhew'd more skin in proving his Queſtion, yet he had ſtill betray'd his want of prudence in the choice of it.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been ſayd, the Reader will be induc'd to think that theſe Papers do not ſo much concern the Church of England, as the State; and that a Reply to them is not ſo properly the task of a Divine, as of a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer. The Civil power is indeed manifeſtly ſtruck at, and an Anſwer might eaſily be fetcht from <hi>Keble</hi> and <hi>Coke.</hi> He may perſwade himſelf that he acts craftily, but certainly he acts very inconſiſtently, who erects a Triumphal Statue to his Prince, and at the ſame time undermines his Autority; in monumental Inſcriptions gives him the glorious and aſtoniſhing Title of <hi>Optimus Maximus,</hi> and yet ſets up a ſuperiour Power to his. If nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Loyalty nor gratitude could perſwade him to ſpeak more reverently, yet out of warineſs he ought to have been more cautious in laying down ſuch things, as ſeem to have an ill aſpect on his Majeſties proceedings. For
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48657:144"/>it may ſeem very raſh to deny,<note place="margin">§. 5. p. 12.</note> that the Prince can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from the Exerciſe of his Office any of his Clergy for not obeying his Deciſions in matters of a Spiritual Nature, when a Reverend Prelate ſuffers under ſuch a Sentence;<note place="margin">§. 7. p. 14.</note> to aſſert that the Prince, ought not to collate to Benefices, where the Clergy have Canonical excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Perſon nominated, whilſt a Friend of his thus qualified enjoys the benefit of ſuch a Collation; to find fault with the Reformers that they gave their Prince leave to diſpenſe with Laws and Conſtitutions Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical,<note place="margin">§. 28. p. 36.</note> when he himſelf is in that caſe moſt graciouſly diſpens'd with. How far the Regal power extends it ſelf in theſe caſes, eſpecially as it may be limited by the municipal laws of the Realm, I am not ſo bold as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; but where ſuch Rights are claim'd by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and actually exercis'd, there it becomes not the modeſty of a private Subject to be ſo open and liberal in condemning them. But then above all he renders his Loyalty juſtly queſtionable, when he tells us it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the Roman Doctors, and leaves it a Queſtion,
<q>Whether in caſe that a Prince uſe his coactive Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Spiritual matters againſt the Definitions of the Church,<note place="margin">§. 16. p. 20.</note> then the Pope hath not alſo virtually ſome Temporal coactive power againſt the Prince? namely to diſſolve the Princes coactive Power, or to authoriſe others to uſe a coactive power, againſt ſuch a Prince in order to the good of the Church?</q> Now I appeal to the judicious Reader, whether the ſubſtance of that infamous Libel, which was part of a late<note n="*" place="bottom">See Sidney's Trial.</note> Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour's Indictment, and which was written by way of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical Diſcourſe, as he pleaded, might not if manag'd by this Author's pen have been thus warily expreſt;
<q>Whether in caſe that a Prince uſe his coactive Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48657:144"/>in Civil matters againſt Acts of Parliament, then the Parliament hath not alſo virtually ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral coactive power againſt the Prince; namely, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Princes coactive power, or to authorize others to uſe a coactive power againſt ſuch a Prince in order to the good of the State?</q> Such bold Problems as theſe ought not to be left undecided; and one who had any zeal for his Prince, would ſcarce let the Affirmative ſide of the Quaeſtion paſs without affixing a brand on it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Expreſſions among others He might well be conſcious would be offenſive to any SIR <hi>of known Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Loyalty to his Prince;</hi> and therefore ſuch perſon's good Opinion was to be courted in an Epiſtle Apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. But certainly it was expected that the kind

                  <p>Now if by <hi>dubious</hi> he means ſuch things as He does not doubt, but they are Spiritual, then this doth not reach our caſe; becauſe <hi>We</hi> may <hi>doubt</hi> whether ſome things are not Temporal, which He <hi>doubts</hi> not but they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; But if by <hi>dubious</hi> He means ſuch things as are <hi>doubted</hi> by no body but that they are purely Spiritual, then are we agreed; ſince neither do We allow the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Prince any power in things of which We our ſelves <hi>doubt</hi> not but they are purely Spiritual. That there are ſome Powers merely Spiritual, appropriated to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and incommunicable to the Prince, no true Son of the Church of England will deny; but now altho' the ſubſtance of thoſe Powers be immediately from God, and not from the King, as thoſe of Preaching, Ordaining, Abſolving &amp;c. Yet whether theſe are not ſubject to be limited, inhibited, or otherwiſe regulated in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Exerciſe of them by the Laws of the Land, and the Autority Regal is the thing quaeſtion'd. This cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be better expreſt then in the words of the Reverend Bp. <hi>Sanderſon;</hi>
                     <q>The King doth not challenge to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as belonging to him by Virtue of his Supremacy Eccleſiaſtical the power of Ordaining Miniſters, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating ſcandalous Offenders, or doing any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act of Epiſcopal Office in his own Perſon; nor the power of Preaching, Adminiſtring the Sacraments, or doing any other act of Miniſterial Office in his own perſon: but leaves the performance of all ſuch acts of either ſort unto ſuch perſons, as the ſaid ſeveral reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive powers do of divine right belong to, <hi>viz.</hi> of the one ſort to the Biſhops, and of the other to the Prieſts. Yet doth the King by Virtue of that Supremacy chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a power as belonging to him in the right of his<note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſcopacy not prejud. to Reg power p 22</note>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48657:145"/>Crown, to make Laws as well concerning Preaching, Adminiſtring the Sacraments, and other acts belonging to the Function of a Prieſt, as concerning Ordination of Miniſters, proceeding in matters of Eccleſiaſtical Cogniſance in the Spiritual Courts, and other acts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Function of a Biſhop: to which Laws as well the Prieſts, as the Biſhops are ſubject, and ought to ſubmit to be limited and regulated thereby in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of thoſe their ſeveral reſpective Powers; their claim to a <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> and that their ſaid ſeveral powers are of God notwithſtanding.</q> Now to apply this; That the deciding Controverſies of Faith, and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Offenders, &amp;c. are the proper Province of the Clergy, we deny not; but that the indicting Synods in order to ſuch Matters, or making Laws to regulate the Exerciſe of them are purely Spiritual, is not ſo <hi>undoubted</hi> as He would perſwade us. Again, that the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Autority which is to be exerciſed in the Epiſcopal or Sacerdotal Functions can be derived from none but thoſe ſpiritual perſons who were inveſted with that Autority, and power of delegating it to others, is willingly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd; but that collation to Benefices can be the act of none but the Clergy will not be hence infer'd. For the Spiritual Autority it ſelf, and the application of it to ſuch an Object are very different things. The power by which a Clergy man is capacitated for his Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is derived from the Biſhop which ordains him; but the applying this Power to ſuch a Place, the ordering that the Eccleſiaſtical Perſon ſhall execute that Autority which he deriv'd from the Church in ſuch a peculiar part of the Kingdom is not without the reach of the Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; and therefore Collation to Benefices (in the ſence this Author underſtands it) ſhould not have been reckon'd by him amongſt thoſe things of which it is not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48657:146"/>
                     <hi>doubted</hi> but they are purely Spirituall. Another power of which he abridges the Prince, and by conſequence would have to be eſteem'd purely Spiritual, is the depoſing from the Exerciſe of their Office in his Dominions any of the Clergy for tranſgreſſing of the Eccleſiaſtical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. Now that the Secular Prince ſhould have an Obligation from God over all Perſons in all Spiritual matters to bind them by Temporal Puniſhments to the Obedience of the Churches or Clergy's determinations, and decrees (as he words it) and yet that the Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this power, their performing what they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to by God, ſhould be without the reach of their Autority, ſeems to me a paradox. That the Chriſtian Emperors in the Primitive times challeng'd ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is plain from the undoubted teſtimony of the Learned <hi>Petrus de Marca.</hi>

And indeed this ſeems to be a Neceſſary branch of power, which naturally flows from his being <hi>Cuſtos Canonum,</hi> which he is prov'd by this Author at large to be. How far the Prince may abridge himſelf of this power by the laws of the Land, I meddle not; it ſuffices to ſhew that it is not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally a power merely Spirituall. And from this and the former Inſtances the Reader will be able to judge the truth of that aſſertion, That there is nothing touch'd in this Diſcourſe concerning ſuch Matters, as it is
<hi>dubious</hi> whether they be Spiritual, or Temporal.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to that other aſſertion of his,
<q>That he knows not of any Eccleſiaſtical powers in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe denied to the Prince but which (or at leaſt the chiefeſt of which) all other Chriſtian Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe of the Reformed States do forego to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if by the <hi>chiefeſt,</hi> which he excepts, he means preaching the word, and adminiſtring the Sacraments, Excommunicating, and abſolving; neither do the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed States challenge the Exerciſe of theſe; and as for others it will appear that the Princes of the Roman-Catholick Communion extend their Supremacy as far as the Reformed.</p>
                  <p>And here it may not be improper to inſtance in that right which the Kings of Spain enjoy in Sicily, which ſeems to extend even to thoſe Spiritual powers which our Author calls the

See; ſo that he and his Viceroys in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence have the ſame power over the
<hi>Sicilians</hi> as to the Spiritual that a Legate <hi>à latere</hi> could have. And therefore they who execute that Juriſdiction of <hi>Sicily</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> have power to abſolve, puniſh, and excommunicate all ſorts of perſons, whether La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks or Eccleſiaſticks, Monks, Prieſts, Abbots, Biſhops, and even Cardinals themſelves, that reſide in the Kingdom. They acknowledge not the Popes Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, being Sovereign Monarchs as to the Spiritual. They confeſs that the Pope hath heretofore given them that priviledge:</q> 
                     <hi>(So that his Holineſs it ſeemes thought even thoſe chiefeſt Powers of the Church alienable)</hi>
                     <q>but at the ſame time they pretend that it is not in his power to recall it; and ſo they acknowledge not the Pope for head, to whoſe Tribunal no Appeal can be made becauſe their King has no Superiour, as to the Spiritual. Moreover this right of ſuperiority is not conſider'd as delegate, but proper; and the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> or they who hold Juriſdiction in his place, and who are Lay-men take the title of <hi>Beatiſſimo &amp; Santiſſimo Padre</hi> attributing to themſelves in effect in reſpect of <hi>Sicily</hi> what the Pope takes to himſelf in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the whole Church; and they preſide in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Councils.</q> As for the title of <hi>Head</hi> of the Church which taken by the Reformers ſo much offends our Diſcourſer, this Critical Hiſtorian farther obſerves;
<q>It was matter of great aſtoniſhment that in our age Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> took the title of <hi>Head</hi> of the Church

<q>that he knew of no Eccleſiaſtical powers denied to the Prince but which (or at leaſt the chiefeſt of which) all other Chriſtian Princes, except thoſe of the Reformed State, do forego to exerciſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But our Diſcourſer perhaps preſum'd his Friend a Stranger to ſorreign affairs, and therefore thought he might the more ſecurely uſe a Latitude in his treating of thoſe; it remains therefore to examine whether he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48657:150"/>has been a more faithful Relator of our own Hiſtory, and what truth there is in his laſt Epiſtolary aſſertion, that
<q>he knows not of any Eccleſiaſtical powers in this Diſcourſe denied to the Prince, but what the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have foregone before <hi>Henry the</hi> 8th. Now whatever in relation to a power in Spirituals is in this Diſcourſe accus'd of Novelty ſeems eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to theſe two Heads:</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. A Supremacy in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical denied to the <hi>Weſtern Patriarch:</hi> as appears by our Princes taking away all manner of Forreign Juriſdiction, prohibiting all appeals to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> all Bulls from it, and in generall all Intercourſe with it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. The ſame Supremacy inveſted in the Sovereign; as appears by King <hi>Henry's</hi> aſſuming the title of <hi>Head</hi> of the Church; by the Kings making Eccleſiaſtical Laws; by that Synodical act of the Clergy not to aſſemble or promulgate any Canons without his leave; by that power granted to the King to viſit Eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to reform Errours and Hereſies; by his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Benefices without conſent of the Clergy; and by hindring Excommunications <hi>in foro externo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in Anſwer to this charge of Novelty; It is confeſt that the Pope did for ſome Years uſurp ſuch a ſuperiority; but then, as it is granted that he did <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto</hi> claim ſuch a power, ſo that it did <hi>de jure</hi> belong to him is denied; and not only ſo, but farther we affirm, that he neither from the beginning challenged ſuch a power, nor was he afterwards in ſo full poſſeſſion of it, but that our Princes have upon Occaſion vindicated their own right againſt all Papal, or, if he pleaſeth, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal</hi> Encroachments. And here waving the diſpute of <hi>right</hi> I ſhall confine my ſelf to matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> that being the only caſe here controverted.</p>

                  <p>Where 1ſt of the Supremacy of the <hi>Weſtern-Patriarch.</hi> That when <hi>Auſtin</hi> came over to convert the <hi>Saxons,</hi> no ſuch Supremacy was acknowledg'd by the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Chriſtians is evident from the celebrated Anſwer of <hi>Dinoth</hi> Abbot of Bangor to <hi>Auſtin</hi> requiring ſuch ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Notum ſit Vobis &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48657:154"/>contrary to the Determinations of the Church; for the Church is here ſaid to have been corrupt in that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in which the King was Orthodox; to alter the Conſtitutions of General Councils becauſe repugnant to the law of God; for this Omiſſion of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was <hi>ex uſu ſecundi Concilii Niceni,</hi> and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images here forbidden was introduc'd by that Council which the Romaniſts acknowledge Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.

<hi>any</hi> Eccleſiaſtical powers in this Diſcourſe denied to the Prince, but which were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
                  <p>As for what he adds,
<q>that no more Supremacy in ſuch Eccleſiaſtical matters,<note place="margin">Ep.</note> as are delegated by Chriſt to the Clergy and are unalienable by them to any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power, can belong to the Princes of one time or of one Nation, then do to any other Prince of a former Time, or a diverſe Nation, We willingly acknowledge it, ſince no ſuch powers belong to <hi>any</hi> Prince, at <hi>any</hi> time; or of <hi>any</hi> Nation.</q> But then there is a Supremacy in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical matters delegated by God to the Prince, which may be invaded by a Forreigner under a forg'd pretence of his being Head of the Church; and here Secular Laws may be made for the protection of ſuch Rights, and for the puniſhment of thoſe who ſhall either invade them, or vindicate ſuch Invaſion.

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48657:156"/>
                  <p>Having dwelt hitherto on the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and diſcover'd ſo much Inſincerity in that, which yet was to beſpeak the Reader's good Opinion of the enſuing Diſcourſe, We have no great reaſon to expect any fairer dealing in the proſecution of his deſign. And here I ſhall be excus'd if I be the ſhorter in the Examination of his <hi>Theſes,</hi> both becauſe they are ſuch as being propos'd only and not prov'd, it lies in our power to accept, or reject them at pleaſure; as alſo becauſe they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready undergone the Cenſure of a Noble Pen, and have not been able to abide a fair Tryall. Some of them are ſo ambiguouſly expreſt that they may be either true or falſe according to the different conſtruction they are capable of. The falſ-hood of others is ſelf-evident; But then for the better vending of theſe, ſome truths are intermix'd according to the policy of <hi>Luther's</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt obſerv'd by his Biographer<note n="*" place="bottom">Conſid. concerning Luther § 48. p.
90.</note>,
<q>Who, to make his bad wares ſaleable, diligently mixeth ſome ſmall ſtock of good with evil, ſo to make this more cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and all eaſily ſwallow'd down together by the imprudent and credulous.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Artifice much practis'd by our Author is that he lays down his Propoſitions in general terms, but afterwards reſtrains them by ſuch limitations, which if adher'd to would make them utterly diſſerviceable to his Cauſe; but then when they come to be applied, the
<hi>Theſes</hi> are refer'd to at large without any regard to ſuch limitations. Thus when in his firſt <hi>Theſis</hi> he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<q>That it is not in the juſt power of the Prince to deny giving the Miniſters of Chriſt licenſe to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Office,<note place="margin">§. 3. p 4.</note> and their Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures in his Dominions.</q> He means he ſaith in general, for he meddles not with the Prince, his denying ſome of them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48657:156"/>to do theſe things whilst he admits others. Now if this Reſtraint be obſerv'd, then all which he would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh from this <hi>Theſis</hi> will come to Nothing. For he will not, I believe, preſume to ſay that the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Princes ever laid a general Interdict upon all the Clergy to prohibit them the exerciſe of their Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Functions. This is an Act which the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation deteſts, and which we leave to the charitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Univerſal Paſtor, who by Virtue of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Command of
<hi>Paſce oves;</hi> challenges to himſelf a power of depriving the flock of all Spiritual food. Thus again, When in his third <hi>Theſis</hi> he has aſſerted that the Secular Prince cannot eject from the exerciſe of their Office in his Dominions any of the Clergy,<note place="margin">§. 5. p. 12.</note> nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the <hi>Patriarch</hi> from any Autority which he ſtands poſſeſt of by Eccleſiaſtical Canons, He reſtrains ſuch Canons to thoſe only <hi>that cannot juſtly be pretended to do any wrong to the Civil Government.</hi> Now he knows that all Canons which would obtrude upon us a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign uſurp'd Autority are by us
<hi>pretended</hi> (whether <hi>juſtly</hi> or not, they will beſt judge who impartially weigh our Reaſons) <hi>injurious to the Civil Government.</hi> Another Limitation of this
<hi>Theſis</hi> is
<q>that the Civil power may judge, and eject,<note place="margin">§. 8. p. 16.</note> and diſauthorize Spiritual Perſons for Moral and Civil Miſdemeanors damageable to the Common-Wealth;</q> But this Limitation is forgot when from this <hi>Theſis</hi> He would prove the ejection of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time unlawful; For their Deprivation was for refuſing the Oath of Supremacy made firſt by Roman-Catholicks in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's time, and reviv'd by Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> ſo that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of it depends merely on the Right of the Civil power to make Oaths for the better ſecurity of their Government, and to impoſe ſuch Penalties as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48657:157"/>in the Law on the Violators; and if ſuch Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal be damageable to the Common-Wealth (as it was then judg'd) then the Deprivation of thoſe Refuſers will be juſtifiable according to his own Principles. Thus again in his 8th <hi>Theſis</hi> When he has laid down,
<q>That as for things of meer Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution,<note place="margin">§. 14. p.
18.</note> Neither National Synod, nor Secular power may make any New Canons contrary to the Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions of former Superior Councils, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe thoſe formerly made by them.</q> He reſtrains it to thoſe only <hi>as neither the Prince can ſhew ſome way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to his Civil Government, nor the National</hi> Synod <hi>can ſhew more prejudicial to their particular Church, then the ſame Conſtitutions are to the reſt of Chriſtian Churches.</hi> (Where by the way methinks it ſhould ſuffice if they were aequally prejudicial, for one Church is never the leſs wrong'd becauſe another ſuffers.) Now we deſire no more then the benefit of this limitation; for if the Prince may reverſe ſuch Conſtitutions when
<hi>prejudicial to Civil Government,</hi> and the National Synod when <hi>praejudicial to their particular Church,</hi> and each of Theſe are Judges of ſuch praejudice, (for neither doth Aequity admit, nor doth He appoint any other Arbiter) then each of theſe have as much power granted them as they challenge, which is only to alter ſuch Conſtitutions as are prejudicial to them. Having praemis'd thus much in general, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd the Reader againſt this piece of Sophiſtry, which runs through the greateſt part of this Diſcourſe, I ſhall now proceed to a particular ſurvey of his <hi>Theſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the firſt and ſecond, I ſhall at preſent grant him that favour which he ſeems to requeſt of all his Readers, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſuppoſe them to be true, and ſhall content my ſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examin what Inferences he deduces from them. And here I cannot but commend his Policy for ſetting
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48657:157"/>his <hi>Concluſions</hi> at ſo great a diſtance from his
<hi>Praemiſſes,</hi> for they are commonly ſuch as would have by no means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ſtand too nigh together.</p>
                  <p>From his firſt and ſecond <hi>Theſis,</hi>
                     <q>that the Clergy have power to determine Controverſies in pure matters of Religion, and to judge what is divine truth, what are Errors; &amp; that they cannot alienate this Power to the Secular Prince;</q>
                     <note place="margin">§. 22. p. 29.</note> he infers That that Synodical Act of the Clergy in K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, whereby they promiſe not to Aſſemble without the King's Writ, nor when Aſſembled to execute any Canons without the King's conſent, is unlawful. Now it is to be obſerved that the Clergy neither do deny that they have a Power to determine Controverſies in pure matters of Religion, which is what the firſt <hi>Theſis</hi> would prove; nor do they transfer ſuch a Power on the King, which might be againſt the Tenor of the ſecond. The utmoſt which can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd hence is, That the Clergy did for prudential mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives limit themſelves in the Exerciſe of one branch of their Spiritual Power; and it will be difficult for this Author to prove that He, who has a power <hi>jure divino,</hi> may not by
<hi>humane Laws</hi> be limited in the Uſe of it. Husbands have a power over their Wives, Fathers over their Children, and Maſters over their Servants by the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and yet this power may be regulated by the <hi>Laws of the Land.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 27. p.
36.</note> Thus the Prieſt has a power to bind and looſe from our Saviour's Commiſſion, and yet according to this Author, before the Reformation the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Clergy might not exerciſe any Church Cenſure contrary to the Commands of their lawful Spiritual Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior. Thus alſo if a General Council have power to determine matters of Faith, then according to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they have power to convene in order to ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, and this power of theirs is unalienable; and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48657:158"/>yet the Romaniſts will not allow that ſuch Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be made at pleaſure, but that the <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> are determinable by the Pope, who only has power to indict Councils, and to give Autority to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, which yet derive their power from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil's being infallible, and from the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                  <p>Another Act, which from the ſame <hi>Theſis</hi> he accuſes of Injuſtice, is
<q>the Clergy's beſeeching the King's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the Conſtitutions and Canons Provincial and Synodal,<note place="margin">§. 25. p. 31.</note> which be thought prejudicial to the King's Prerogative Royal, or repugnant to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, or to be otherwiſe overmuch onerous to his Highneſs and his Subjects may be committed to the judgment of his Highneſs, and of 32 Perſons, 16 of the Temporally, and 16 of the Clergy of this Realm to be choſen and appointed by the King's Majeſty, and that ſuch Canons, as ſhall be thought by the more part of them worthy to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null'd, ſhall be made of no value, and ſuch other of the Canons as ſhall be approv'd to ſtand with the Law of God &amp;c. ſhall ſtand in power.</q> Now it is to be conſider'd that the Laws, which the Clergy here deſire may be revis'd, are of a far different Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inſpection of them may well be committed to different Judges. Some of them were ſuppos'd <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the King's Praerogative Royal, or repugnant to the Laws of the Realm,</hi> and here the Lay-Commiſſioners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons of the upper and lower Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſee the Stat.) were, the beſt Judges; Of others it was to be enquir'd Whether they were <hi>agreeable to the word of God or not,</hi> and here the Clergy were ready to give their Determination. And altho' they both acted in a joynt Commiſſion yet no good reaſon ſeems
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48657:158"/>aſſignable why both Lay and Eccleſiaſtical Judges ſhould be appointed, but that, the matters to be examin'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of different cognizance, thoſe which related to <hi>Civil</hi> Affairs ſhould be determin'd by the <hi>Temporalty,</hi> thoſe which were of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature by the <hi>Spiritualty.</hi> And if ſo, then the deciding of theſe matters is not transfer'd from the Spiritualty to the Temporalty, but from one part of the Clergy to another. And this He himſelf, after all his deſcants upon this Act, confeſſeth,
<q>For, whatever ſenſe the words in the Praeface of this Act were or may be extended to,<note place="margin">§. 26.10.</note> I do not think the Clergy at firſt intended any ſuch thing, as to make the King or his Commiſſioners Judges of matters of Faith or Divine truth: and for this Opinion of his He gives us his Reaſons in that, and the ſubſequent pages.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Act, which is by this Author judg'd contrary to his firſt <hi>Theſis,</hi> is that Statute of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth which orders
<q>that no ſpeaking, holding, or doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Laws call'd Spiritual Laws made by Autority of the See of Rome, which be repugnant to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm,<note place="margin">§ 34. p. 39.</note> or the King's Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative ſhall be deem'd to be Haereſie, from which he infers that the King and Parliament undertake to be Judges of Haereſie.</q> Now the King and Parliament do not here in my Opinion take upon them to decide mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, but only to Enact that in ſuch a caſe the Subject ſhall not ſuffer the Puniſhment uſually inflicted on Haereticks; Whether ſuch ſpeaking or doing be Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie or not, they have power to ordain that it ſhall not be deem'd ſo <hi>i. e.</hi> the Speaker ſhall not ſuffer as an Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. Something parallel to this we have in that <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of much concernment</hi> (to uſe our Author's expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of another Act) made 23.
<hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. Wherein it is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48657:159"/>enacted that <hi>The Perſons who ſhall withdraw any of the Queens Majeſties Subjects from the Religion eſtabliſhed by Law to the Romiſh Religtion, ſhall be to all intents ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd as Traytors, and ſhall ſuffer as in caſes of High Treaſon, and the like of Perſons willingly reconcil'd.</hi> Where without diſputing whether every ſuch Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler, or Reconciled, is neceſſarily for that Act <hi>ipſo facto</hi> a Traytor, all that is here enacted is that he ſhall ſuffer as ſuch; For it is undoubtedly within the reach of the Civil Power to ordain where they will inflict or not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict their Secular Puniſhments, without being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for this to any Autority under God's. And it ſeems very hard that if a Subject expreſſes himſelf, or acts againſt ſuch Laws of a Forreigner as are repugnant to the Laws of his own Country, there the Prince cannot exempt him from a Writ <hi>de Haeretico comburendo</hi> without invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Churches right.</p>
                  <p>Another Act condemn'd by Virtue of his 1ſt and 2d <hi>Theſes</hi> is
<q>The Convocation's granting to certain perſons to be appointed by the King's Autority to make Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical laws,<note place="margin">§. 43. p. 56.</note> and purſuant to this, 42 Articles of Religion publiſh'd by the Autority of King <hi>Edward</hi> in the 6th Year of his Reign.</q> Now not to engage my ſelf in a diſpute Whether theſe Articles were not really what in the Title praefix'd they are ſaid to be? <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuli de quibus in Synodo London, A.

                     <q>The King's Majeſty has the chief power in this Realm of England, and other his Dominions: Unto whom the chief Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Eſtates of this Realm, whether they be Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical or Civil, in all cauſes doth appertain, and is not or ought not to be ſubject to any forreign Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</q> So far for the extent of this power; but now for the reſtraint.
<q>Where we attribute to the King's Majeſty the chief Government, by which Titles we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the minds of ſome <hi>ſlanderous folks</hi> to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, We give not to our Prince the miniſtring ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God's word, or of the Sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions alſo, lately ſet forth by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> do moſt plainly teſtify, but that only Prerogative which We ſee to have been given always to all Godly Princes in Holy Scriptures by God himſelf, that is, that they ſhould rule all Eſtates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Eccleſiaſtical or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and reſtrain with the Civil Sword the Stubborn &amp; evil doers.</q> It is therefore by our Author to be prov'd that they who give no more to their Prince, then <hi>hath been given always to all Godly Princes in Holy Scripture by God himſelf,</hi> do alienate to the Secular Governour any Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Office which they (the Clergy) have receiv'd and been charg'd with by Chriſt, with a command to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſame to the end of the World; which being a Contradiction I leave it to him to reconcile.</p>
                  <p>That by this Oath, or any other Act of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> a greater Power was either aſſum'd by her ſelf, or given to her by Others, then is conſiſtent with that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48657:160"/>Autority that is given by our Saviour to the Church will be very difficult for any Reaſonable man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive who ſhall have recourſe to the Injunction of this Queen to which this very Article refers us;

<hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, which is and <hi>was of Ancient time</hi> due to the Imperial Crown of this Realm; that is, under God to have Sovereignty and Rule over all manner of Perſons born within theſe her Realms, Dominions, and Countreys, of what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate either Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal ſoever they be; ſo as no other forreign Power ſhall or ought to have any Superiority over them.

                     <hi>Theſis</hi> is King <hi>Henry the Eth's</hi> claiming a right that no Clergy-man, being a Member of the Church of England, ſhould exerciſe the power of the Keys in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in any Cauſe or on any Perſon without his leave and appointment. But it is to be remembred that the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures aſſerted to belong to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in the firſt
<hi>Theſis</hi> have reference to the things only of the <hi>next</hi> world; but the cenſures here ſpoken of, are ſuch as have reference to the things of this world. The Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Juriſdiction of Biſhops flows, we confeſs, from their Ordination; but the Actual exerciſe thereof in publick Courts after a coercive manner is from the gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Sovereign Princes.</p>
                  <p>From the 1ſt and 2d <hi>Theſis</hi>
                     <q>he farther condemns the taking away the Patriarch's Autority for receiving of Appeals,<note place="margin">pag. 99.</note> and exerciſing final Judicature in Spiritual Controverſies, as alſo the taking away the final judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deciſion of ſuch Controverſies not only from the Patriarch in particular, but alſo from all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in general, not making the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> or Convocation, but himſelf or his Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the Judges thereof.</q> For which he refers us to <hi>Stat.</hi> 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8.19. c.

Here is nothing of <hi>determining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in pure matters of Religion, of deciding what is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48657:161"/>Gods word, and divine Truth, What are Errors in the faith or in the practiſe of Gods Worſhip, and Service,</hi> nor any of the other <hi>Spiritual</hi> powers by him enumerated in the 1ſt <hi>Theſis;</hi> Or if any ſuch Quaeſtions should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the Cauſes to be tried, Why may not the Commiſſioners, if Secular, judge according to what has been praedetermin'd by the Clergy? or let us ſuppoſe a caſe never yet determin'd, How doth he prove a power of judging in ſuch cauſes transfer'd on ſecular Perſons, ſince if Occaſion requir'd, the Delegates might be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Eccleſiaſtical?</p>
                  <p>But not only the Acts of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> but the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of our Doctors are to be examin'd by his Teſt, and therefore from the ſame <hi>Theſes</hi> he cenſures that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Heylins Ref. Juſtified, part. 1. §. 6.</note>
                     <note place="margin">p 240.</note>, that it is neither fit nor reaſonable that the Clergy ſhould be able by their Synodical Acts to conclude both Prince and People in
<hi>Spiritual</hi> matters, until the ſtamp of Royal Autority be imprinted on them. Now it is plain to any one that views the Context, that the Dr. ſpeaks of ſuch a concluding the Prince and people in matters <hi>Spiritual,</hi> as hath influence on their <hi>Civil</hi> rights. For he there diſcourſes of the Clergy under King <hi>Henry</hi> obliging themſelves not to execute thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Canons without the <hi>Kings</hi> conſent which formerly they had put in Execution by their <hi>own</hi> Autority. But the Canons ſo executed had the force of
<hi>Civil</hi> Laws, and the Violators of them were obnoxious to <hi>Secular</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Dr. therefore very juſtly thought it unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable any ſhould be liable to ſuch Puniſhments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>His</hi> conſent, who only has the power of inflicting them; Nor is this inconſiſtent with our Authors firſt <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> (had he at ſo great a diſtance remembred it) which extends Church-Autority only to Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48657:161"/>which have reference to things not of this, but the next World.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Inferences which I find deduc'd, from his firſt and ſecond <hi>Theſes</hi> in the ſeveral parts of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which had they been as concluſive, as they are falſe, yet I do not find but that his own party (if that be the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>) had ſuffer'd moſt by them. For if the Supremacy given to King <hi>Henry</hi> was ſo great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the Churches right, what ſhall we think of that Roman Catholick Clergy, who ſo Sacrilegiouſly inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with this <hi>Spiritual</hi> power? If that Synodical Act was betraying the truſt which the Clergy had receiv'd from Chriſt, what ſhall we think of thoſe Paſtours, who ſo unfaithfully manag'd the <hi>Depoſitum</hi> of their Saviour?

<hi>Romaniſts</hi> which is written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt: If not, we ſeem to have juſt praejudices againſt a Religion which had no greater influence over its Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, then to ſuffer a whole Nation of them perfidiouſly to deny that, which if it be any part, is a main Article of their Faith? But to return to our Author, What ſhall we judge of his skill in Controverſie who from Principles aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd <hi>gratis,</hi> draws Deductions which by no means fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and which if they did follow, would be the greateſt Wound to that cauſe which he pretends to Patronize? But becauſe he has offer'd ſomething under this firſt <hi>Theſis,</hi> why the Prince ſhould pay an implicit Obedience to his Clergy, I come now to conſider it.
<q>He tells us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Prince profeſſeth Himſelf with the reſt of the Chriſtians as to the knowing of Spiritual Truths a Subject and Scholar of the Church; and he earneſtly claims a Supreme power and confeſſeth an Obligation from God over all Perſons in all <hi>Spiritual</hi> Matters to bind them upon Temporal Puniſhments to Obedience of the
<hi>Churches</hi> (or <hi>Clergy's</hi>) Determinations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</q> But here he either willingly miſrepreſents, or ignorantly miſtakes our Principles; For the Prince claims a ſupreme power over all perſons, to bind them by temporal Puniſhments to the Obedience not of the <hi>Churches,</hi> but of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Laws; or of the <hi>former,</hi> no farther then they are agreeable with the <hi>latter.</hi>
                     <q>But, ſaith He,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48657:162"/>if the Prince meaneth here only where himſelf firſt judgeth ſuch their Decrees Orthodox and right, this power is in effect claim'd to bind all perſons in all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual matters only to his <hi>own</hi> Decrees; whilſt he prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends an Obligation both of himſelf and His Subjects to the <hi>Churches.</hi>
                     </q> But, what if the Prince judge ſuch Decrees neither
<hi>Orthodox</hi> nor <hi>right?</hi> Muſt he here give them the Autority of Civil Sanctions? This is to eſtablish Iniquity by a Law; and a power is claim'd in effect to bind all perſons to the Decrees of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> whilſt, as has been ſaid, He praetends an Obligation of Himſelf &amp; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Laws of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But he goes on and tells us,
<q>That all Texts of the New-Teſtament do ordain Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Church-men to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Princes, that then Reigned, no leſs then to <hi>others.</hi>
                     </q> From which I ſuppoſe he would infer an exemption from Obeying the Prince in <hi>Spiritualibus.</hi> But ſuppoſing that all Texts do aequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordain Obedience to Princes <hi>Pagan,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> yet the Obedience to a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prince will be of greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſince becauſe he profeſſes the true Religion, his Commands in <hi>Spirituals</hi> not contradicting our Saviours will exact our Compliance. Obedience in <hi>licitis</hi> is all the Subject ow's to a Prince either
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> on <hi>Infidel;</hi> but the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Prince will oftner challenge my Obedience, becauſe he more rarely tranſgreſſeth the bounds of <hi>licita.</hi> If as he adds,
<q>all Princes are oblig'd with the Sword which God hath given them to protect and defend his
<hi>true</hi> Religion, and Service in their Dominions, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it offers it ſelf to them;</q> Since many Religions <hi>offer</hi> themſelves, it becomes the Prince to take Care which is the <hi>true;</hi> and not to take, whatever is offer'd; which would be utterly deſtructive of our Authors Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. As for the <hi>Acts of Ancient Councils obliging even without the Emperours conſent,</hi> We own their Obligation
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48657:163"/>over their proper Subjects, ſo far as they were agreeable with the Laws of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; and urge the Autority of Emperours no farther then as adding their
<hi>Civil</hi> power to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Power of the Church. And here we challenge no other Power to our Princes, then was exercis'd by Chriſtian Emperours, that is, to call Synods, and to have a liberty of confirming, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming their Decrees by <hi>Civil</hi> Sanctions. As for what he cites out of our Writers, all amounts to no more then this, that there are ſome Offices peculiar to the Church; Which neither do we deny, nor did our Princes ever invade theſe Functions. But becauſe from hence He would inſinuate that the Prince has no power at all in Cauſes <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> &amp;c in his Citations from theſe Writers comes up to that Character which the<note n="*" place="bottom">Book of Educ Ox. 1677 p 86.</note> 
                     <hi>Book of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> gives us of <hi>the SLY, the CLOSE, and the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERV'D, who take notice of ſo much at ſerves to their own deſigns, and miſinterpret and detort what You ſay even contrary to Your intention;</hi> I ſhall as briefly as may be ſhew that their Conceſſions are far from giving any Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to his Cauſe.

                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Soave Hiſt. of Conc. Tr. Pag. 77.</note> 
                     <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or eject from the exerciſe of their Office in his Dominions any of the Clergy, nor introduce others into the place of the ejected.</hi> But the Quaeſtion here is not, Whether the Prince can <hi>eject</hi> any of the Clergy from the <hi>Exerciſe of their Office,</hi> but, Whether he can depoſe any for <hi>not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing</hi> it? While the Clergy faithfully diſcharge their Office, the Prince ought to protect them; and if for this they ſuffer, no doubt but they are Martyrs. But it is poſſible they may <hi>abuſe</hi> their power, and then it is to be enquir'd, Whether Civil Laws may not inhibit them the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of it? This Author holds the Negative, and tells us 1ſt. They cannot eject them at pleaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any cauſe thereof. But he doth not pretend that the Reforming Princes ever ejected any without a Cauſe given. And therefore he adds <hi>2ly,</hi> Neither may Princes depoſe them for any Cauſe which concerns things <hi>Spiritual;</hi> but with this Limitation, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Clergy. I could wiſh he had here told us what he ment by things <hi>Spiritual.</hi> For things, as well as Perſons Spiritual are of great Extent. (d Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d told the Duke of Mantua, that it is the Opinion of the Doctors, that Prieſt's Concubines are of Ecclſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Juriſdiction.) But he gives us his reaſon for his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion;
<q>Becauſe it is neceſſary that a Judge to be a competent one have as well
<hi>poteſtatem</hi> in <hi>cauſam,</hi> as in <hi>Perſonam,</hi> and the Prince as has been mention'd in the 1ſt <hi>Theſis</hi> has no Autority to judge ſuch Cauſes purely
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48657:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>Spiritual.</q> Now the power denied to the Prince in the 1ſt
<hi>Theſis</hi> is to determine matters of Faith. But may not the Prince judge whether an Eccleſiaſtick deſerves Deprivation without determining a Matter of Faith? May not he judge according to what has been already determin'd by the Church? Or may not he appoint ſuch Delegates as can determine matters of Faith? Or are all the Cauſes, for which a Clergy-man may be depriv'd, merely Spiritual? By Virtue of this <hi>Theſis</hi> he proves the Ejection of the <hi>Weſtern Patriarch</hi> unlawful.<note place="margin">pag. 37.</note> Now was not this Matter of Faith already determine by the Clergy? Had they not unanimouſly decreed, That he had no more Autority here, then any other forreign Biſhop? And can the King be ſaid here to have acted <hi>without the conſent of the Clergy?</hi> And yet that matter of fact is applied to this <hi>Theſis.</hi> As for the Ejection of the Biſhops in King <hi>Edward's</hi> time; is not that confeſt to have been <hi>for not acknowledging the Regal Supremacy?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">pag. 70.</note> But this was a matter which wanted no new Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for the <hi>Church-Autority</hi> had decided it in their Synod in King <hi>Henry's</hi> Reign. But it is ſaid,
<q>the Judges were not Canonical, as being the King's Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, part <hi>Clergy,</hi> part <hi>Laity.</hi>
                     </q> But neither was the cauſe purely Canonical; for denying the Supremacy was not only an infringment of the Canon, but alſo a Violation of an Act of Parliament. As for the Biſhops, <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Gardiner,</hi> they were accus'd for not aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Civil power of the King in his Nonage. Nor do they plead Conſcience for not doing it, but deny the Matter of Fact<note n="*" place="bottom">Burn. Hiſ.

<q>That the Sentence being only of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48657:167"/>from their Sees, it was not ſo entirely of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Cenſure, but was of a mix'd nature, ſo that Lay-men might joyn in it; &amp; ſince they had taken Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions from the King for their Biſhopricks, by which they held them only during the Kings pleaſure, they could not complain of their Deprivation, which was done by the King's Autority. Others who look'd farther back, remembred that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emp. had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Secular</hi> Men to enquire into ſome things objected to Biſhops, who were call'd <hi>Cognitores,</hi> or <hi>Triers;</hi> and ſuch had examin'd the buſineſs of
<hi>Coecilian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> even upon an Appeal, after it had been tried by ſeveral Synods; and given Judgment againſt <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and his party. The ſame
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> had alſo by his Autority put <hi>Euſtathius</hi> out of <hi>Antioch, Athanaſius</hi> out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> out of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and though the Orthodox Biſhops complain'd of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as done unjuſtly at the falſe ſuggeſtion of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> yet they did not deny the Autority of the Emperors in ſuch caſes.</q>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 127.</note> But neither is the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Canterbury by this Author allow'd to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judge; &amp; that, <hi>becauſe He did not Act by his Canonical Superiority in the Church, but by the Autority he joyntly with the reſt receiv'd from the King;</hi> As if he had ever the leſs the power of a Metropolitan, becauſe He was alſo the King's Commiſſioner. By this way of arguing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Oecumenical Councils will be invalid, becauſe they were call'd to determine Controverſies by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Emperors.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48657:168"/>that <hi>as the Prince cannot eject, or depoſe the Clergy, ſo neither can he introduce any into the place of thoſe, who are ejected, or deceas'd without the concurrence of the Clergy.</hi> If by the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence</hi> of the Clergy, he means that the Perſon aſſign'd by the Prince to any ſacred office cannot execute it till he be <hi>ordain'd</hi> by the Clergy, No one will deny it; Or if he think that the Ordainer ought to lay hands on none but whom he eſteems fit for the diſcharge of ſo ſacred an Office; here alſo we agree with him; But how doth it follow that becauſe Ordination, which is conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men to the work of the Holy Miniſtry, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Office of the Clergy, the Prince may not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Church a fit Perſon ſo to be conſecrated, or aſſign to the Perſon already conſecrated, the place where he ſhall perform that Holy Work? As for the Canons by him alledg'd, they being Humane Inſtitutions are not of Aeternal Obligation, but changeable according to the different State of the Church.

How comes the latter part of the 6th Canon of the Nicene Council which concerns the Election of Biſhops ſtill to be valid, and the former part, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Juriſdiction of Patriarchs, ſo long ſince to be null?

<hi>Patriarch</hi> or a Synod, yet either of theſe might ſo manage their truſt that a corrupted majority of Clergy might ſtate divine matters according to their own mind, and ſo the Doctrines of Chriſt be chang'd for the Traditions of men. But to theſe objected Injuries which the Church may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from a bad Prince, we ought to oppoſe the benefit ſhe receives from the Protection of a good one; Nor is it more true that <hi>Conſtantius an Arrian, by his unjuſtly diſplacing the Orthodox Biſhops, procu'd Arrianiſm to be voted in ſeveral Eaſtern Synods,</hi> then that the ſucceeding Emperors by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48657:169"/>juſtly diſplacing the Arrian Biſhops procur'd the Nicene Faith to be receiv'd in ſucceeding Synods. But for theſe miſchiefe, which a National Synod is liable to, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has found out, as he thinks, a Remedy in his</p>
                  <p>Fourth Theſis, <hi>That a Provincial, or National Synod may not lawfully make any definitions in matters of Faith, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſome Error, or Hereſy, or other abuſe in God's Service contrary to the Decrees of former Superior Synods, or contrary to the judgment of the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal of the preſent Age ſhew'd in her publick Liturgies.</hi> But there is a
<hi>Theſis</hi> in our Bibles, which ſeems to me the very contradictory of this. For ſaith the Prophet expreſly,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſ. 4.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Though Iſrael tranſgreſs, yet let not Judah Sin.</hi> Tho' ten tribes continue corrupted in their Faith, yet let the remaining Tribe take care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her ſelf.

                     <hi>Judah kept not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord her God, but walk'd in the Statutes of Iſrael which they made.</hi> But this argument of <hi>National</hi> Councils reforming without the leave of <hi>General</hi> has been manag'd with ſo great Learning and Demonſtration by Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> in his Diſcourſe with <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and his Lordſhip's Arguments ſo clearly vindicated by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend D. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> that as it is great Praeſumption in this Author to offer any thing in a cauſe which has had the Honour to have ſuffer'd under thoſe Pens, ſo neither would it be modeſt in me to meddle any farther in a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie by them exhauſted. I ſhall therefore proceed to his</p>
                  <p>Fifth Theſis, <hi>That could a National Synod make ſuch Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, yet that a Synod wanting part of the National Clergy unjuſtly depos'd, or reſtrained; and conſiſting partly of perſons unjuſtly introduc'd, partly of thoſe who have been firſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Fines, Impriſonment, and deprivation, in caſe of their Non-conformity to the Princes Injunctions in matters purely
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48657:170"/>Spiritual, is not to be accounted a lawful National Synod, nor the Acts thereof free and valid; eſpecially as to their eſtabliſhing ſuch Regal Injunctions.</hi> Now how this is pertinent to our caſe I can by no means conjecture. For it has been ſhew'd that neither were the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reforming Bps. unjuſtly depos'd, nor the Reformers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly introduc'd. But what he means by the Clergy's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing threatned with <hi>fines, impriſonment,</hi> and Deprivation in caſe of their Non-conformity to the Prince's Injunctions may be learnt from another paſſage in his Diſcourſe, where he tells us that the Clergy being condemn'd in the Kings Bench in a <hi>Praemunire</hi> for acknowledging the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's power Legantine, and ſo become liable at the King's pleaſure to the <hi>Impriſonment</hi> of their Perſons, and
<hi>Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their Eſtates,<note place="margin">pag 26.</note> did to releaſe themſelves of this <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire,</hi> give the King the title of <hi>Eccleſiae &amp; Cleri Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani Protector, &amp; Supremum caput.</hi> Which Act, ſaith he, ſo paſſed by them, that, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> acknowledges, It is eaſie to believe that Nothing but the apprehenſions of dangers, which hung over them by a Praemunire incurred by them could probably have inclined them to it. But here we have great reaſon to complain of the unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable praevarication of this Author in ſo foully miſreprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> Which that it may be the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and that the Reader may make from this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance a true judgment of this Writer's ſincerity, it will be neceſſary to tranſcribe the whole paſſage as it lies in the Doctor.<note place="margin">Sch. c 7. §. 5.</note>
                     <q>Though the firſt act of the Clergy in this was ſo introduc'd, that it is eaſie to believe that nothing but the apprehenſion of dangers which hung over them (by a Praemunire incurr'd by them) could probably have inclin'd them to it, and therefore I ſhall not pretend that it was perfectly an Act of their firſt will and choice, but that which the Neceſſity of affairs recommended
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48657:170"/>to them, Yet the matter of right being upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion taken into their moſt ſerious debate in a Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way, and at laſt a fit and commodious expreſſion uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly pitch'd upon by joynt conſent of both Houſes of Convocation, there is no reaſon to doubt, but that they did believe what they did profeſs, their fear being the Occaſion of their Debates, but the Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments obſerv'd in debate, the cauſes, as in all Charity we are to judge, of their Deciſion.</q> Thus the Doctor.

Laſtly, he ſmothers Dr. <hi>Hammond's</hi> ſenſe expreſs'd clearly by himſelf, that <hi>there is no reaſon to doubt, but that they did believe what they did profeſs, the fear being the Occaſion of their debates, but the reaſons or Arguments offer'd in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, the cauſes (as in all charity we are to judge) of their Deciſion.</hi>

<hi>Theſis</hi> but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe another to it, <hi>That could an Oecumenical Synod make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions contrary to the word of God, yet that a Synod wanting the greateſt part of Chriſtian Biſhops, unjuſtly excluded, and conſiſting partly of Perſons unjuſtly introduc'd, partly of thoſe who have been first bribed with Mony, and promiſes of Church-praeferment, or praeengag'd by Oaths to comply with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a praetended Spiritual Monarch, is not to be accounted a lawful Oecumenical Synod, nor the Acts thereof free and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, especially as to their eſtabliſhing ſuch uſurpations.</hi> This is a
<hi>Theſis,</hi> which needs no Application. I proceed to his</p>
                  <p>Sixth <hi>Theſis. That the Judgment and conſent of ſome Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of a Province, when they are the leſſer part, cannot be call'd
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48657:171"/>the judgment and conſent of the Whole Clergy of the Province.</hi> This Aſſertion, that a leſſer part is not aequall to the Whole, is the only thing which looks like Mathematics in the whole Diſcourſe; and the Reader may hence be convinc'd that our Author doth ſometimes travel in the<note n="*" place="bottom">

<hi>according</hi> to truth are not to be obey'd rather then the <hi>Major</hi> part judging
<hi>contrary</hi> to it. In the mean time it is eaſily reply'd, that the judgment and conſent of ſome few Biſhops (<note n="*" place="bottom">Soave Hiſt, Conc. Tr. p. 153.</note> ſuppoſe 48. Biſhops, and 5. Cardinals giving Canonical Autority to books Apocryphal, and making Authentical a tranſlation differing from the Original) cannot be eſteem'd the judgment and conſent of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church.</p>
                  <p n="7">7th. Theſis. <hi>That ſince a National Synod may not define matters of Faith contrary to former Superior Councils, much leſs may any Secular Perſon define contrary to thoſe Councils, or alſo to a National Synod.</hi> The defining matters of Faith we allow to be the proper office of the Clergy; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every one muſt give an account of his own Faith, every one is oblig'd to take care that what he ſubmits to the belief of, be conſiſtent with his Chriſtianity: I am oblig'd to pay all ſubmiſſion to the Church-Autority, but the Church having bounds, within which ſhe ought to be reſtrain'd in her Determinations, if ſhe tranſgreſſes theſe Limits, and acts againſt that Chriſtianity, which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to maintain, I may rather refuſe obedience, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit my Chriſtianity. If in a cauſe of this moment I make a wrong Judgment, I am anſwerable for it at Gods Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, not becauſe I uſurped a right, which was never gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, but becauſe I miſus'd a Liberty which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48657:172"/>me. This we take to be the caſe of each private Chriſtian; and farther, that the Prince having an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only to believe a-right, and Worſhip God (as is praeſcrib'd) himſelf, but alſo to protect the true Faith and Worſhip in his Dominions, ought to uſe all thoſe means of diſcovering the Truth, which God has afforded, <hi>viz.</hi> conſulting the Paſtours of the Church, reading the word of God <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that, having diſcover'd it, He may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate it to His Subjects by them alſo to be embrac'd, but not without the uſe of that Judgment and Diſcretion which to them alſo is allowed. If here it happens that the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical power command things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there is nothing to be done by the Subject but to enquire on which ſide God is; and if God be on the King's ſide by a direct Law in the matter, He is not on the Churches ſide for her Spiritual Autority.

Now from an Examiner we might juſtly expect <hi>Argument,</hi> and from a Relator, <hi>Truth.</hi> How he <hi>argues</hi> I find conſider'd by the <hi>Animadverter:</hi> Two ſmall defects he has been charg'd with. 1ſt. That he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon dubious or falſe
<hi>Premiſes; 2ly,</hi> That were they granted, his <hi>Concluſions</hi> would not follow. It is my buſineſs to examine his <hi>Narrative,</hi> which yet is not ſo purely
<hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> but that it is perplex'd with diſpute. For it is peculiar to this Author that when he ſhould <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> he barely affirms, as if he was writing an
<hi>Hiſtory;</hi> but when it is his buſineſs to <hi>relate,</hi> being conſcious that the ſtream of Autority is againſt him, he is forc'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it out as if he was proving a
<hi>Problem.</hi> But his <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing</hi> is ſuch, as the Cauſe would bear; and his
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſuch, as it neceſſarily requires. The former has gain'd him no great credit with the <hi>Men of Reaſon;</hi> and this, I doubt, will little recommend him to the
<hi>Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Ingenuous.</hi> But I forbear to prejudge the cauſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing may be farther <hi>charg'd</hi> on him, than it is <hi>prov'd.</hi> I pretend to no Critical skill in the Hiſtory of the Reformation, and I am beholden to the Author that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48657:177"/>I need it not. His prevarications lie ſo open, that a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in Hiſtory may detect them. Should I give a complete Catalogue of 'em, I ſhould out-ſwell the bulk of
<hi>Church-Government;</hi> but I conſider that every one, who deſires to know this Author, may not be willing to be charg'd with a <hi>Volume.</hi> I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confine my ſelf to ſuch only, as are worthy of this Writer, and beyond the aim of a common Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker.</p>

But before I enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, I would acquaint the Reader once for all, that the glory of theſe Fables is owing to the Pen of the inimitable <hi>Sanders:</hi> Who was ſo great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Invention, that no <hi>Ingenuous</hi> Author would have condeſcended to tranſcribe him. He does not however pay ſuch an implicit deference to the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Character of that great Original, but that he dares refine upon thoſe Strokes, which ſeem'd inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of improvement. That he may give us a taſt of what we are to expect in the body of his <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> he entertains us in the firſt entrance into it with a falſe and groundleſs aſperſion of the Marriage of King <hi>Henry</hi> with <hi>Ann Bullen.

                        </note>, where he will find the <hi>Act of Illegitimacy</hi> repeal'd in Expreſſions ſo full and vigorous, that it is hard to imagine what could tempt our Author to ſo extravagant an Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the ambition of exceeding all Examples. But the citing of an Act, which, when conſulted, proves the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory of that for which it was refer'd to; and the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Repeal of a Statute, which is abrogated in as plain words as poſſible, do not furniſh Matter enough for a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48657:178"/>
                        <hi>Parentheſis</hi> with this Author. To cloſe it therefore a paſſage is cited from a Diſpenſation, which he has <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd</hi> from <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh. Since <hi>he</hi> urges us with this Diſpenſation, it is to be hop'd that he eſteems it genuine. If ſo, we have met with a Bull, wherein the Marriage betwixt King
<hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Katherine</hi> is declar'd null and invalid. But he, who in this Paragraph cites a paſſage from Pope <hi>Clement's</hi> Bull of Divorce, will, in the next Paragraph but one,<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>19</label> ſhew us that the Pope was not ſingular in his Judgment, when he refus'd to grant ſuch a Bull. It is indeed certain that the Pope was both <hi>for</hi> and <hi>against</hi> the Divorce according as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Intereſts inclin'd him; but this is a truth, which it ill becomes a <hi>Roman-Catholic</hi> to confeſs. All Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries agree that a Bull was brought over by Cardinal <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegio;</hi> but that this, which our Author refers to, could be the Copy of that or of any other Bull is abſurd to imagine. For tho' falſe Latin and incoherence are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no arguments of its being ſpurious, yet there is in it one Blunder, which I dare not think his Holineſs could be guilty of. The Pope after he has declar'd the Marriage of King <hi>Henry</hi> with <hi>Catharine,</hi> as being his Brother's Relict, null, gives the King licenſe to contract<note n="a" place="bottom">See the Bull in Anti-Sanderus, or in Lord Herbert's Hiſt. of King Hen. 8th. p. 279.

As for the Clauſe of Diſpenſation here cited, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in all his ſallies has not miſcall'd that Prince, if he was ſo fatally ſtupid, as that when he pretended ſcruples of Conſcience for having married the Relict of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd Brother, he could at the ſame time deſire the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48657:179"/>Pope to diſpence with his Marrying within the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Affinity.

Tho' had he founded his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that ſuppoſition, It, if I may ſo ſpeak with due reverence to an Act of Parliament, was neither a bare conjecture, nor untrue.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Heſitancy of the German-Proteſtant Divines to declare the Divorce lawful.</hi> I cannot conceive why
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48657:183"/>it is urg'd by this Author who certainly doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Judgment of theſe <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-Doctors to the contrary Determination of the <hi>Roman-Catholic</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. It has been obſerv'd upon this Author's writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that he is no great Friend of either Communion, of which We have here a very good Confirmation; when to prove the illegality of K. <hi>Henry's</hi> Divorce, he declines the Autority of the <hi>Roman-Catholic</hi> Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as Mercenary, and appeals to the <hi>German</hi> Divines, whom he will have to be of his Opinion.

Every Government has a right to diſpence with it's own Acts, and nothing farther is challeng'd in that Statute. No Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions had ever the force of Laws in this Kingdom, but from the Legiſlative power of the Realm: and the ſame power, which gave them life, might diſpenſe with them. This the <hi>Act</hi> ſaith is evident not only from the wholeſom Acts made in King
<hi>Henry's</hi> Reign, but from thoſe made in the time of his Noble Progenitors. It was not therefore a power now firſt attributed to the Prince, but his Ancient Right, for ſome Years indeed uſurp'd by the Pope, but now vindicated. This is the true import of that Statute, which when it is fairly repreſented is at the ſame time juſtified. The power of granting Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is indeed taken <hi>from the Pope,</hi> to whom it never right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonged; but <hi>not from the Clergy,</hi> it being expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in the Act, that all Licenſes be granted by

                        <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi> ſubſcrib'd moſt of theſe Articles; but this was not for his Intereſt to obſerve. His remark is that <hi>tho' in ſome of theſe Articles the Autority of Parliament is mention'd, yet in none of theſe is any thing ſaid of the Conſent of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as neceſſary to make ſuch Parliamentary or Regal injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons valid.</hi> That the conſent of the Clergy was urg'd to this Biſhop, I hope he does not deny; I am ſure<note n="c" place="bottom">§. 110. it is urg'd by <hi>r.</hi> that in the charge given in againſt
<hi>Gardiner</hi> it is ſaid, that the Injunctions were of all men for all ſorts obediently receiv'd. And that this charge was given in, is not denied in the Reply to <hi>r.</hi> §.
119.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where He confeſſes it. The meaning muſt be, that this conſent was not urg'd under the modality of making the Regal Injunctions valid, Nor do I ſee any Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it ſhould; for <hi>Gardiner</hi> had not yet ſo far refin'd his <hi>groſs</hi> ſenſe of the Supremacy, but that he ſtill own'd his Obligation to obey His Majeſtie's Godly Injunctions and Ordinances concerning Religion. Neither could the Impoſers of theſe Injunctions, according to their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, lay ſo great a ſtreſs on the conſent of the Clergy; for if the matter of the Injunctions was unlawful, no Church-Autority could make them lawful; but if it was agreeable to the Law of God, then the <hi>Civil</hi> Autority without the <hi>Synodal</hi> (if that had been wanting) was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. From this idle remark the Author has rais'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48657:191"/>as idle a Conſequence; From this non-mentioning the conſent of the Clergy he <hi>collects, that when the Synodal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Clergy is any where elſe mention'd, as ſometimes it is, it is not to add any Autority to theſe Injunctions thereby.</hi> Now to me it ſeemes a wild Inference that becauſe the Synodal conſent was once not urg'd <hi>as neceſſary,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when-ever it was urg'd, it was thought to add <hi>no</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority. I may certainly obey my <hi>Prince</hi> in a thing law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, tho' my <hi>Pastor</hi> doth not at the ſame time exact this Obedience from me; But when they both require the ſame Duty, there ariſeth a new tie of Obedience, and I am now under a double Obligation. But leaſt we ſhould wonder why the King and Parliament never pleaded any Neceſſity of the Synodal conſent, the Author conjectures the reaſons to be, <hi>1ſt. Becauſe ſome of the Voters were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd, and ſo their ſuffrage leſs Authentical.</hi> But theſe places were ſupplied, and then I would know why thoſe, who ſucceeded into their <hi>Paſtoral</hi> charge, did not alſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed into their <hi>Synodal</hi> Autority? and if ſo, why the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers ſhould think the Act of a Synod leſs Authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal when <hi>Ridley</hi> ſat there, than when <hi>Bonner</hi> did? His ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon is, Becauſe <hi>they ſaw that the Laws of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Clergy could ſtand in no force, but ſo would alſo the Laws of the Church, and her Synods which were ſuperior to the Engliſh Clergy; And if the King urg'd his and his Subject's freedom from the Laws of the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, ſo muſt He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from the Laws of his own Church National. Church, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Synods,</hi> and the <hi>Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> are words, which ſound big; but when they come to be conſtrued, the <hi>Laws of the</hi> Church, ſignifie <hi>Papal Decrees; Superior Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi> are put for any <hi>Council</hi> that is <hi>forreign;</hi> and the <hi>Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> dwindles into <hi>Roman-Catholic.</hi> In this caſe I hope we may obey our Lawful Paſtors, tho' we reject an Uſurper; Nor are we quitted from our Obligation to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48657:191"/>the juſt Autority of our own Biſhops; becauſe we do not ſubmit to the Invaſions of Forreigner.

                     <p>WE are come now to Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> Reign, the fatal Revolutions of which We would willingly forget, did not the unſeaſonable importunity of theſe Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh our memories.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48657:193"/>him that this Prince, who thus <hi>reverſes, repeals,</hi> and
<hi>ejects,</hi> was the ſame<note n="a" place="bottom">Burn. V. 2. p 237.</note> that gave the
<hi>Suffolk</hi> men full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that ſhe would never make any Innovations or changes in Religion; The ſame, that made an open De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in Council,<note n="b" place="bottom">Bur. V. 2. p. 245.</note> that though her own Conſcience was ſtaid in matters of Religion, yet ſhe was reſolv'd not to compel or reſtrain others: So that this after repealing reflects ſeverely on thoſe Guides, who had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Conſcience, and thoſe Principles, by which She acted. <hi>Lay-Supremacy</hi> was indeed at laſt ejected by her, but not till the other parts of the Reformation were reverſt by it's Influence. If ſending out Injunctions in matters Eccleſiaſtical, uſing the Title of Head of the Church, convoking Synods, ejecting Biſhops by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, prohibiting ſome Preachers, licenſing others, inhibiting the Pope's Legate to come into the Kingdom, if theſe, I ſay, are admitted to be ſigns of a Lay-Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, it muſt be confeſt that Q. <hi>Mary</hi> was ſuch a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme. It is not therefore Regal Supremacy, as ſuch, but as countenancing the Reformation, which theſe men condemn.

                        <hi>Cranmer,</hi> the only remaining Biſhop in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, was eſteem'd Arch-Biſhop till he was degraded for Hereſie; ſo that he indeed was depriv'd of his See, and of his Life together, for the Cauſes alledg'd. Now as for thoſe, which were ejected for Marriage, it was warranted by the Law of God, the Autority of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, the Statutes of the Realm, and the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical Act of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy. Nor is it to any purpoſe, which our Author urges, that theſe Acts of the Parliament and Synod were repeal'd; ſince a repeal could only abrogate the Law for the future, not void it from the beginning; it might make that <hi>Marriage ſhould be,</hi> not that it ſhould <hi>have been</hi> unlawful; it might legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the proceedings againſt theſe Biſhops if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd their Wives, not warrant the deprivation of them for what was paſt. Nor is it more material which is here urg'd, that the Laws which legitimated ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage were void in their making, as being contrary to the Canons of Superior Councils, untill it be proved that thoſe Councils, which prohibited ſuch Marriage, were our lawful Superiors, and, if ſo, had power to lay ſuch a Yoke upon their Subjects. For theſe Councils he refers me to the <hi>Diſcourſe of Celibacy,</hi> and for a Reply I refer him to the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it. As for the next 3 Biſhops <hi>Taylor, Hooper,</hi> and <hi>Harley</hi> their Judges were not to ſeek for a Cauſe, who had power to declare their Sees void, <hi>as they were already void.</hi> But let us at laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Cauſes of their Deprivation the ſame as are by him alleg'd; as it is confeſt they were the Cauſes, for which <hi>Cranmer</hi> was depriv'd, and for which He and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were burnt; Yet whether theſe were juſt Cauſes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48657:196"/>of Deprivation or not, doth not depend upon this Man's confident Aſſertion, but on the truth of the thing. It ſeems ſomething arrogant thus Magiſterially in one breath to condemn all thoſe Doctrines of the Reformation, which have hitherto ſtood the ſhock againſt all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and their Faggots; their <hi>Bellarmines</hi> and their
<hi>Bonners.</hi> The Reformers for ſome Years have been writing and dying in Juſtification of theſe Doctrines, and doth this Author at laſt think that the very naming of them is Evidence enough that thoſe Biſhops, who were ejected for their adherence to them, were rightfully eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as to the Cauſe? But it is enough with theſe Men to condemn an Opinion, that it is not their own; For as for the truth of particular Doctrines, whether there be a Trinity, whether Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt be God, or the like, theſe, we are told,<note n="a" place="bottom">Guide in Controv.

                        <hi>are things that trouble none, who hath once undergone the Mortification of dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his own Judgment, and hath captivated it to the Unity of the Church's Faith.</hi>

                     <p>What has been ſaid in this Chapter cannot want a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation. The ejection of Biſhops in King <hi>Edward's</hi> time was to have been prov'd unlawful, becauſe for an unlawful Cauſe, and by an unlawful Judge; the ejection of Biſhops in Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> time lawful, becauſe for a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cauſe, and by a lawful Judge: the Judges in both caſes were the ſame,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Commiſſioners of each Prince; the Cauſes in neither are rightly aſſign'd; and of thoſe which are aſſign'd, Nothing is ſaid to prove their reſpective lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs. This is the great Argument of the Chapter; to repeat all the falſ-hoods in it, would be to tranſcribe it.</p>

If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Articles do in nothing diſcede from Popery, it is becauſe the <hi>New</hi> Popery of this Age has diſceded much from the <hi>antiquated</hi> Popery of the former. It is noted,
<hi>that the King by Virtue of his Supremacy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands theſe Injunctions to be accepted by his Subjects, not as appearing to him the Ordinances or Definitions of the Church, but as judg'd by him agreeable to the Law of God.</hi> Our Author had little matter for Cenſure, when He urg'd this as an Accuſation. It is <hi>imputed</hi> that he paid more deference to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Law, then to the Act of a <hi>Convocation;</hi> and choſe rather to reſolve his and his Subjects Obedience into the Autority of <hi>God,</hi> then of <hi>Man.</hi> Thus are We taught that we muſt put out our Eyes, e're We can follow Our Spiritual Guide, as We ought; and in our Faith preſcind from <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Autority, if We will approve our ſelves good
<hi>Catholics.</hi> For if what is enjoyn'd by the Church ſeem agreeable to the Word of God, and therefore is accepted, ſuch acceptance is accus'd of not being ſufficiently reſigning; So that no one, according to theſe Principles, is a true Son of the Church, but he who pays a blind Obedience to her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, either without any regard to God's Laws, or in formal Oppoſition to them.</p>

<hi>adjudging</hi> Hereſie, I am not ſo ſubtle a <hi>Nominaliſt</hi> as to determine.
<hi>Hereſie</hi> was no farther of the Parliament's cognizance, then to declare, how it ſhould be puniſh'd. It was, in this ſenſe, of the Parliament's cognizance before King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th<hi>'s</hi> time, when the Laws were made againſt <hi>Lollards,</hi> and after King

                     <p>He has <hi>dwelt the longer on theſe Inſtances that</hi> We <hi>may ſee, when a Prince (together with his Particular Clergy,</hi>

                        <hi>or rather whom out of them He ſhall chooſe) claims a power of compoſing Models of Chriſtian Faith, and declaring all thoſe his Subjects Heretics, who do not believe and obey ſuch his Determinations; what danger, what mutability occurrs in ſuch a Nation, as often as this Independent Head is not every way Orthodox.</hi> It concerns not us, what ill Conſequences may attend the claim of ſuch a power, untill it be prov'd that we aſcribe ſuch an Autority of
<hi>New-Modelling the Faith</hi> to our Princes. The <hi>Apoſtolic, Nicene,</hi> and
<hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Creeds we receive and embrace; but I know not of any <hi>Henrician</hi> Creed incorporated into our Faith. The
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48657:201"/>Romaniſts have a Creed Younger by ſome Years then King <hi>Henry;</hi> but nothing is a part of our Faith, but what ſprung up with Infant-Chriſtianity. It is therefore a wild Inference, that becauſe we own the King to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head of the Church, therefore We make the Chriſtian Religion mutable. Did we make Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the Rule of our Faith, there would be ground for ſuch an Objection; For then an Article of Faith might be enacted and repeal'd at pleaſure, and He, who was <hi>Orthodox</hi> in one Seſſion, might become an
<hi>Heretic</hi> in the next. But Scripture is the Rule of our Faith, a Rule like it's Author, unchangeable; <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> indeed is obnoxious to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Prince, but <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is without the reach of his Sword. Nor has the King this influence over the external profeſſion of Religion, as he is the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Head,</hi> but as he is the <hi>Civil Supreme.</hi> God has intruſted him, as ſuch, with the power of the Sword, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand indeed to uſe it for the protection of the <hi>true</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but with a natural liberty ſtill of uſing it for the Protection of a <hi>falſe.</hi> This Author, I confeſs, has a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt this, namely,
<hi>ſome Temporal coactive power lodg'd in the Pope, in order to diſſolve upon Occaſion the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active power of the Prince;</hi> But we do not envy him this <hi>Catholicon</hi> againſt Innovation. Paſſive Obedience is our Principle, and if this renders the legal Eſtabliſhment of our Religion more obnoxious to the pleaſure of the Civil Magiſtrate, Yet it better ſecures our common Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Q. <hi>Mary</hi> therefore may repeal King <hi>Edward's</hi> Laws, but unleſs ſhe could repeal <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Law too, <hi>Ridley's</hi> and <hi>Latimer's</hi> Religion will ſtill be the ſame; The only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, that the Faith, which before they defended from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> they now more effectually propagate at the <hi>Stake.</hi> To conclude this point; whilſt Princes have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48657:201"/>the power of the Sword, and Subjects are oblig'd to Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance, the Supreme Governor will have an influence over the outward State of Religion; and He, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of this, repines againſt the Methods of God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It is no blemiſh therefore on the
<hi>Reform'd</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (which is here dwelt upon by this Author) that it went forward or backward under King <hi>Henry,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as his different paſſions or Intereſts inclin'd him. Whilſt Q. <hi>Ann</hi> liv'd it had indifferent ſucceſs, ſaith <hi>Fox. Here then,</hi> ſaith our witty Obſerver, <hi>the Supreme Head of the Church was directed by a Woman, and manag'd the Affairs of Religion accordingly.</hi> Now admitting this were a truth, which had eſcap'd him, Yet the curious Editor, I doubt not, amongſt his Collections has met with a Medal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> with the Pope's Mitre on her Head, and St.
<hi>Peter's</hi> Keys in her Hands; and on the Reverſe, the Pope with his Head dreſt like a Lady, and a Spindle in his hand. Be it alſo true, <hi>that</hi> Cromwel, <hi>a Laic, had the total management of Eccleſiaſtical affairs under King</hi> Henry, Yet any one, Who is converſant in Hiſtory, knows that the adminiſtration of the Popedom has been in the Hands of more obnoxious Favourites.</p>

                     <p>η Urges that theſe Injunctions were generally receiv'd, and put in practice by the Biſhops; and θ much-what the ſame, that they were conſented to by the major part of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. The Anſwer to this conſiſts of ſome Pages; but what is material in it will ly in a leſs room. It is urg'd that ſome were averſe to the Reformation, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliers were guilty of <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> of an <hi>outward compliance whilſt contrarily affected,</hi> that they <hi>remain'd of the old Religion in their heart, wore vizours, took up a diſguiſe,</hi> and were ſway'd by the fear of a new Law-giving Civil power.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48657:208"/>that party; but that it is little for the honour of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which he would ſeem to be of, to urge, that the whole body of it's Paſtors were guilty of the higheſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication poſſible with God and Man.

What is ſaid here of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſhall be conſider'd in λ, where it ought to have been ſaid. I cannot dwell upon the Hiſtory of theſe Paragraphs; but there are in it ſome bold ſtrokes worthy of our Author. He bluſhes not to cite <hi>Parſon's Converſions,</hi>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>124</label> tho' he refers us to the very Page, he puts upon us four Popiſh Biſhops more then <hi>Fuller</hi> reckons;
<hi>Aldrich</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carlile, Goodrich</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely, Chambers</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oxford.</hi> Now, tho' by the abſolute Autority of a <hi>Church-Governor</hi> he might have impos'd theſe four Biſhops on us, Yet it ſeems very hard that <hi>Fuller</hi> ſhould be commanded to ſatisfie us of this point, who not only mentions no ſuch Biſhops, but in his Marginal notes tell's us, that he thinks <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Ely</hi> were at that time void. We are told that <hi>Cranmer</hi> in the beginning of King <hi>Edward's</hi> days call'd a Synod, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>127</label> wherein he endeavour'd to have effected a Reformation, but could not; for which we are bid to ſee <hi>Antiq. Britann. p.</hi> 339. But he, who would ſee any ſuch thing there, muſt borrow our Author's Spectacles.</p>
                     <p>χ Urges, that it makes no real difference whether a Reformation begin from a Vote of Biſhops in Synod,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48657:208"/>and ſo proceeding to the Prince be by him eſtabliſhed, or take beginning from the Piety of the Prince mov'd by advice of faithful Biſhops, and, ſo proceeding to the whole Body of the Clergy, be by them generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and put in practice according to the command of Sovereign Autority. The Anſwer is, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>130</label> that the King did not propoſe a Reformation to the Clergy by them to be conſulted of, and upon their Aſſent or denial to be eſtabliſh'd or laid aſide, which would have been lawful; but by them to be obey'd, as impos'd by the King, which He thinks unwarrantable. But to this it may be replied, from what has before been urg'd, that the matter of the Command being lawful (not to ſay neceſſary) the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of the Prince is Obligatory, and that the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Biſhops is an Evidence that the matter was by them judg'd lawful.</p>
                     <p>In λ it is urg'd that the firſt Form of Common-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Adminiſtration of Sacraments in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Year and 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Parliament of King <hi>Edward's</hi> reign had the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and conſent of the whole body of the Clergy in Convocation. To this it is offer'd by way of Anſwer, That <hi>no other Act of Reformation before the</hi> 5th <hi>of King</hi> Edward <hi>had the conſent of Convocation.</hi> 
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>126</label> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this true, nor doth it prove that therefore this Liturgy <hi>had not. That it was confirm'd by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament before it had this conſent.</hi> But, granting this, had it therefore not the conſent of Convocation? But, how doth he prove that the Act of Parliament preceded the Decree of the Synod? Becauſe <hi>the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not mention the conſent of Convocation.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Arguments he knows do not conclude, and it is poſitively ſaid in the<note n="a" place="bottom">For. p. 1303.</note> Letter of the Council to Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> that this Liturgy (not only had the Aſſent) but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48657:209"/>was <hi>ſet forth with</hi> the Aſſent of the Clergy in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Our Author himſelf, when he has forgot the debate here, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>146</label> will tell us, that <hi>the Liturgy was at the ſame time authoriz'd by Act of Parliament, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to by Convocation.</hi> But it is ſaid, <hi>the Second Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy was ſent to the Clergy, autoritate Regis &amp; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamenti.</hi> Ergo, the firſt Liturgy had not the conſent of Convocation. But, <hi>a motive to this conſent might be fear of puniſhment.</hi> Yet the<note n="a" place="bottom">Bur. V. 2. p. 101.</note> Convocation, which gave this conſent, acknowledg'd to King <hi>Edward</hi> the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they enjoy'd under him, having no let nor impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Service of God. But <hi>the with-drawing of a few Clergy, eſpecially if prime leaders, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing new Votes of a contrary perſwaſion into their rooms (ſuppoſe taking away ſix old Biſhops, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſix new ones) may render that, which before was a major part, now a leſser, and conſequently the Act of this major part invalid.</hi> This putting of caſes is very impertinent here, for when the conſent of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation was given to the Liturgy, not one old Biſhop was depriv'd. For the Letter to <hi>Bonner</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, which mentions this Aſſent of Convocation to the Liturgy, is directed to him then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who yet was the firſt of the Biſhops depriv'd. <hi>This Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>rather omitted, then gainſaid the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Church-tenents and practice.</hi> This is urg'd by way of Apology for the Convocation's conſenting; but whether the Liturgy <hi>omitted</hi> or <hi>gainſaid</hi> the Church-practiſe, it was one main branch of the Reformation, and it is not denied that it had the Vote of a Synod. The errors reform'd were ſuch as corrupted, either the <hi>Worſhip</hi> or <hi>Doctrine;</hi> that the Reformation of Worſhip had the Autority of a Synod, is after much ſhuffling
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48657:209"/>granted; Whether the Articles, which were the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Doctrine, were not confirm'd by the ſame Autority is to be examin'd?</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48657:212"/>Religion was plac'd in thoſe Obſervances, and yet Senſuality was conſiſtent with them; It was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable therefore to take off thoſe Laws, and yet to keep up ſuch as might make Faſting and Abſtinence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their true End; Which is to be a means to Virtue, and to ſubdue men's Bodies to their Soul and Spirit, the End expreſsly provided for in the Statute. <hi>There is no Obligation,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>for the Obſervation of either Fasting or Abſtinence by any expreſs Canon of this Church Reformed, but only by Act of Parliament.</hi> The days of Faſting are preſcrib'd in the Liturgy, which has the Autority of Convocation; Faſting is enjoyn'd in the Homilies, which have the ſame Autority; It is there recommended from precepts of Scripture, from the Example of Chriſt, and from the Conſtitutions of the Primitive Councils; It is defin'd to be a with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all meat and drink, and all manner of Natural food, in contradiction to this Author, who ſaith, that <hi>not Faſting</hi> is enjoyn'd us, but only Abſtinence from Fleſh; He might with as good reaſon have urg'd, that Praying to God, and believing in Chriſt are not enjoyn'd by the Church, as that Faſting is not; For if by <hi>Canons</hi> he means thoſe, which are properly ſo call'd, neither is there any

42 <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, ſaid to be agreed on in a Synod of the Clergy held at</hi> London. If theſe Articles were the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Act of the Synod, then they were not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of mere Regal Supremacy; and that they were ſo, will, I doubt not, appear, notwithſtanding all his cavils. If any one ſhould queſtion whether the <hi>Iliads</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neids</hi> were the genuine works of <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> the Title they carry, and the Univerſal Tradition, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns them to theſe Authors, would be thought a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Vindication of them. This Author builds part of his Faith on the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and oppoſes it's Decree, in favour of Image-Worſhip, to the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment forbidding it. If I ſhould ask him how he knew ſuch a Decree to be genuine, he would not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, produce the Records, but think it a good Reply, that it is found amongſt thoſe Acts which bear the Name of that Council, and which the Church has allways ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as ſuch. Theſe Articles are publiſhed with the Title of the Synod; this publication was Anno 1553, the next Year to that, in which we ſay they were paſt in Convocation; the Church for the firſt 5 years of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> retain'd theſe Articles as her Doctrine; the Convocation in that Queen's time reeſtabliſh'd them with very little Alteration; they have been appeal'd to, ever ſince, by our Writers as the Acts of that Synod; they have been own'd by our Adverſaries as ſuch; and if ſo general a Tradition of a thing ſo notorious, and ſo lately done, may not be admitted, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is built upon a weak Foundation. But all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, this Author thinks he has good Reaſon to deny that theſe Articles were eſtabliſh'd by that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. Firſt, he tranſcribes what Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> ſaith of this Convocation, which I ſhall not hear copy, becauſe the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48657:213"/>Author has here (once for all) dealt ingenuouſly. Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> ſaith the Records of this Convocation, are but one degree above blanks; and to the ſame purpoſe Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi> But neither of theſe Hiſtorians had ſeen Q <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi> Commiſſion for razing the Records; elſe they could have given us an account, why theſe Regiſters are ſo bare. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="bottom">Heylin's Hiſtory. p.
121.</note> found left upon Record in that Convocation a <hi>Memorandum</hi> concerning the Diſſolution of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that theſe Articles were expung'd by ſome Perſons, who yet were willing that the Diſſolution of a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, which they thought might caſt an <hi>odium</hi> upon the Reformation, might remain upon Record. As for <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's</hi> Aſſertion, <hi>that the Convocation had no Commiſſion from the King to meddle with Church-buſineſs,</hi> it is only a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture which he makes from the ſilence of the Records. <hi>Fuller's</hi> Diſcourſe of the
<hi>Catechiſm</hi> doth not at all affect the <hi>Articles,</hi> unleſs it be prov'd, that by
<hi>Catechiſm</hi> muſt be underſtood <hi>Articles,</hi> which our Author endeavours to perſwade his unwary Reader. For this purpoſe, he next preſents us with a Relation from
<hi>Fox,</hi> concerning the queſtioning of a Catechiſm in the 1ſt Synod of Q. <hi>Mary;</hi> but here he is himſelf again, as will appear to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if he compares this Relation with
<hi>Fox's.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes this Story with this <hi>Epiphonema. This concerning the queſtioning of the Catechiſm and Articles;</hi> whereas in the Relation nothing is ſaid of the <hi>Articles,</hi> but the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm</hi> only. <hi>To clear this point a little farther,</hi> He <hi>finds in</hi> Fox <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> Cranmer <hi>charg'd amongst other things, with being Author of the Catechiſm and Articles, and with compelling men againſt their wills to ſubſcribe</hi> them. Here again he ſhuffles; Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> is not there charg'd for compelling Men to ſubſcribe the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:48657:213"/>but the <hi>Articles;</hi> as appears from <hi>Fox's</hi> relation, as it is tranſcrib'd even by himſelf; but he makes the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> ſubſcrib'd, that it may look like a Synonymous term to <hi>Articles.</hi> Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> anſwer'd to that charge, that he exhorted ſuch as were willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, but compell'd none againſt their wills; Now, where this <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and <hi>Subſcription</hi> was, unleſs in Synod, will not eaſily be anſwered. Having given us theſe three relations, he next proceeds to make reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on them. Firſt he excepts againſt the words in the Title of the Articles,
<hi>de quibus inter Epiſcopos &amp; alios eruditos Viros, &amp;c.</hi> that they ſeem not the ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a Synodal Act, which runs more generally; as thus <hi>[de quibus convenit inter Archiepiſcopos, Epiſcopos, &amp; Clerum univerſum]</hi> or the like. This, which he calls an <hi>ordinary expreſſion,</hi> will ſcarce be found in the Title of any Synodal Act before Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Theſe Articles are by him confeſt to have been ſubſcrib'd by part of the Synod; <hi>Cranmer</hi> who drew up the Articles, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd Subſcriptions to them muſt himſelf be a Subſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; probably alſo <hi>Holgate</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> who was a <hi>Reformer; Archiepiſcopal</hi> Autority therefore might have been mention'd, had they been the Act of only a part of the <hi>Synod,</hi> and therefore that it is not explicitly mention'd (for it is implied in the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi>) can be no argument, that they were the Act of a part only. But the other words in the Title, <hi>ad tollendam opinionum diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſionem &amp; conſenſum verae Religionis firmandum</hi> ſhew they muſt have been the Act of the <hi>whole</hi> Synod, ſince the Opinion of a <hi>part</hi> could not be effectual to ſuch an End. Next he obſerves, that <hi>tho' the</hi> Prolocutor
<hi>in the Synod</hi> 10 Mariae <hi>queſtions, and</hi> Philpot <hi>anſwers concerning the</hi> Catechiſm, <hi>yet they ſpeak not of the</hi> Catechiſm, <hi>but only of the Articles, which were firſt printed at the end of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48657:214"/>and bound up with it, which the Prolocutor therefore calls the</hi> Articles of the Catechiſm, <hi>and propoſeth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the</hi> 28th <hi>of theſe Articles for diſputation; and ſo alſo calls them the Catechiſm, becauſe the firſt Title of this Book is</hi> Catechiſmus brevis, &amp;c. In this Period we have as much crude unconcocted reaſoning, as would have furniſh'd an ordinary Writer for ſome Pages. <hi>Weſton</hi> ill deſerv'd the Office of <hi>Prolocutor,</hi> if ſpeaking of a <hi>Catechiſm</hi> he meant not that, but the
<hi>Articles,</hi> which are two as diſtinct things as can well be imagin'd. The
<hi>Articles</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="bottom">They are ſo bound up together in the public Library.</note> were indeed bound up with the <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> but have a new Title-page, and are as diſtinct from it as the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe of Caelibacy</hi> is from the
<hi>Conſiderations on the Spirit of Martin Luther.</hi> Now had the Anſwerer to the
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations on Martin Luther</hi> entitl'd his Book, an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Diſcourſe of Caelebacy,</hi> or ſhould the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer to <hi>the Diſcourſe of Caelibacy</hi> call his Book a Reply to the <hi>Conſiderations on the Spirit of Martin Luther,</hi> they would not take it ill to be laught at; and yet this is our Author's way of arguing. But the Prolocutor ſpeaks of the <hi>Articles of the Catechiſm,</hi> and therefore muſt mean the <hi>Articles</hi> at the end of the <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> Now this is only a quibbling upon Mr. <hi>Fox's</hi> way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who by the <hi>Articles of the Catechiſm</hi> means no more then the matter of the Catechiſm, as is evident both from the Context, and from <hi>Fox's</hi>

                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48657:214"/>ſaith,
<q>
                           <hi>Philpot</hi> ſtood up and ſpake firſt concerning the <hi>Article</hi> of the Catechiſm, that He thought they were deceiv'd in the Title of the Catechiſm.</q> Where I hope our Author will not underſtand by the ſingular <hi>Article</hi> the 42 <hi>Articles.</hi> And it is obſervable that what <hi>Fox</hi> in Engliſh calls in one place the <hi>Articles of the Catechiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Article of the Catechiſm</hi> in an other, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
<hi>Fox</hi> calls <hi>Catechiſmi liber</hi> in one place, and <hi>Catechiſmus</hi> in the other. So that it is evident our Author here on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſports himſelf with a poor clinch upon the Engliſh word <hi>Article.</hi> But it is ſaid, <hi>that the Prolocutor propos'd the matter of the</hi> 28th <hi>of theſe Articles for diſputation.</hi> I am apt to loſe my patience, when I find one cavilling at this rate, who ſeems not ſo much as to have ſeen King
<hi>Edward's</hi> Articles. The matter propos'd for diſputation was the Natural preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament; but the 28th of King <hi>Edward's</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="bottom">See them in Sparrow's Collections, or Bur. V. 2. Coll.</note> Articles concerns <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> In the
39 Articles as they now ſtand, the 28th concerns the Doctrine of the <hi>Lord's Supper;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he unthinkingly judg'd it muſt have been the ſame in King <hi>Edward's</hi> 42 Articles. But how doth it follow that becauſe the Natural Preſence is ſpoke of in the
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> therefore when another queſtion was propos'd, "whether the
<hi>Catechiſm</hi> was agreed to by the former Synod "by <hi>Catechiſm</hi> there muſt be meant <hi>the Articles?</hi> This is ſuch a Conſequence as ill becomes a Diſciple of
<hi>Occham.</hi> What if the ſame matter be alſo propos'd in the <hi>Catechiſm?</hi> Then I hope propoſing this for diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no Argument, that by the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> is meant the <hi>Articles.</hi> I deſire therefore the Reader to conſult the<note n="b" place="bottom">Inde non efficitur ut nobis ſit corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re praeſens, cum alia divinitatis ejus ſit ratio, humanitatis alia; Haec eſt creata, alia increata; haec in aliquo coeli loco, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la autem ſic ubique eſt, ut coelum &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram impleat, Quod ad corpoream Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti hic in terris praeſentiam attinet (ſi mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na parvis componere licet) ſic Chriſti corpus praeſens eſt noſtrae fidei, ut Sol, cum cernatur, praeſens eſt oculo, cujus corpus tametſi corporaliter oculum non contingat, atque hic in terris praeſens prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenti adſit, tamen corpus Solis praeſens eſt viſui, etiam reluctante intervalli diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia; Sic corpus Chriſti quod in glorioſa ejus Aſcenſione nobis ſublatum eſt, quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que reliquit mundum, &amp; ad Patrem abiit, ore noſtro abeſt, etiam cum ſacroſanctum corporis &amp; ſanguinis ejus Sacramentum ore noſtro excipimus; fides autem noſtra verſatur in coelis, ac intuetur Solem ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiae, ac praeſens praeſenti in coelis haud aliter illi adeſt, ac viſus adeſt corpori ſolis in coelis, aut Sol in terris viſui, &amp;c.

<hi>Catechiſm;</hi> and there is no ſubterfuge for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> is another word for <hi>Articles.</hi> Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot's <hi>words are not applicable to the Catechiſm, but to the Articles only.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48657:216"/>their Synodal Autority to certain Perſons, to be appointed by the King, to make ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Laws as they thought convenient. Now I ſee no reaſon why a
<hi>Catechiſm</hi> doth not as properly come under the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Laws Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> as <hi>Articles;</hi> or how the <hi>Catechiſm's</hi> being drawn up by
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> can be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it could not be meant, but the <hi>Articles;</hi> when the Articles alſo were drawn up by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf proves from
<hi>Fox.</hi> But, <hi>if the</hi> 42 <hi>Articles were fram'd by the Synod, the Prolocutor had no reaſon to get hands to the Catechiſm, as falſly aſcrib'd to that Synod, when what was more oppoſite to what he accounted the Orthodox Religion, namely the Articles, was known to be paſt by them.</hi> It was not the Doctrine of the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> or <hi>Articles,</hi> which was here queſtion'd, but the falſe aſcription of the Catechiſm to the Synod; Now the
<hi>Articles</hi> being undeniably genuine, they content themſelves only to condemn the Doctrine of them; but the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppos'd illegitimate, they ſubſcribe both againſt it's Doctrine, and Autority: Nor could <hi>Philpot</hi> have pleaded, as our Author would have had him, that the Synod's compoſing the <hi>Articles</hi> juſtified the Act of the Delegates compoſing the <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> ſince this might indeed war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Doctrine of the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> but not the entitling it to the Synod.

<q>He thinks them debated and concluded on by a Grand Committee, on whom the Convocation had devolv'd their power, and eſteems it not improbable that theſe Articles being debated and agreed upon by the ſaid

But our Author has ſtill another Objection in reſerve, that <hi>the Arch-Biſhop</hi> Cranmer,
<hi>to whom it would have been an excellent Defence to have ſhew'd theſe Articles to have been ſubſcrib'd by a full Synod, yet pleaded no ſuch thing.</hi> That Reverend Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
<hi>pleaded</hi> that the Opinions, which he maintain'd, were the Doctrines of the Scripture, and Primitive Church; that the rejection of the Pope's Supremacy (the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Hereſie, of which he was accus'd) was the Unanimous Act of the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, which his very Judges had ſolemnly ſworn to. Now if this Plea could avail nothing in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, it muſt have been a weak Plea to have inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on Articles paſt in a Synod call'd by himſelf, and over which he, by reaſon of his <hi>Archiepiſcopal Autority,</hi> had great Influence. This diſpute is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a ſhrewd Remark, which our Author raiſes from a paſſage of Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi> The Dr. obſerves that this Book of Articles was not confirm'd by any Act of Parliament; whence he concludes, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48657:217"/>Religion cannot be call'd a Parliament Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Hence this Author gathers
<hi>that, neither was it a Synodal Religion, becauſe we ſee the Parliaments in King</hi> Edward's <hi>time corroborating the Synods in all other tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the Reformation.</hi> Now tho' there is ground for the Drs. obſervation, becauſe there is never an Act, which formally gives Sanction to theſe Articles, yet there is in one of thoſe very Acts (cited from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in this Pamphlet) that, which quite overthrows our Author's Concluſion. For in the
<hi>Act for Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating Marriages of Prieſts,</hi> it is ſaid that, <hi>the untrue Slanderous report of Holy Matrimony did redound to the High diſhonour of the Learned Clergy of this Realm, who have determin'd the ſame to be moſt Lawful by the Law of God in their Convocation, as well by common Aſſent, as by the Subſcription of their Hands.</hi> Which words plainly refer to the 31ſt of theſe Articles, and are an Authoritative Teſtimony, that they are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Act of the Synod; and had, I doubt not, been expung'd, had the <hi>Commiſſion of raſure</hi> extended to the Statute-Book.</p>
                     <p>I have inſiſted the longer on this particular, becauſe it is a matter of ſome moment, and becauſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has here us'd more then ordinary Artifice; I have not had the benefit of any Regiſters, or Manuſcripts, nor am I skill'd in theſe niceties of Hiſtory: What has been ſaid, ſufficiently overthrows all his Cavils; but the Curious and the Learned are able to give a more Authentic and Solid account of this matter.</p>

                     <p>THat the Reformation was reſtor'd by Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> after the extirpation of it by Q.
<hi>Mary,</hi> might have been ſaid in fewer lines than this Author is pleas'd to uſe Paragraphs. That ſome things were at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd without <hi>Synodal</hi> Autority, I confeſs; and that the Reformation had it's laſt ſettlement by a <hi>Synod,</hi> he cannot deny. The Act of the firſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I eſteem <hi>illegal,</hi> becauſe the Q. had ſent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd them under the pain of a <hi>Premunire</hi> not to make Canons. The Canonicalneſs of Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> Clergy, here acting, depends upon his former Proofs, which were not altogether Demonſtrative. But let their Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be ſuppos'd juſt, yet theſe Conſtitutions were repeal'd by a later Synod, whoſe Autority muſt be conceded equal; and therefore their Act, as being the laſt, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritative. The ſtreſs therefore of the Controverſy lies in this, whether Q. <hi>Elizabeth's new</hi> Biſhops were lawfully introduc'd; and this depends upon the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ejection of the <hi>Old.</hi> The Cauſe of their ejection is confeſt to be their denial of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> and is juſt, or unjuſt, according as that <hi>Oath</hi> was lawful, or unlawful. Our Author therefore ſets himſelf to examine that <hi>Oath;</hi> where he firſt puts his own Expoſition upon it, and then attacqs it, as ſo expounded. Neither Q. <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> explication of her own Senſe, nor the Church's Expoſition in her <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> favour his Conſtruction. Thoſe, who take this <hi>Oath,</hi> are not perſwaded that they abjure the Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a <hi>General Council,</hi> or the Juriſdiction of their own <hi>National Clergy.</hi> But if we accept it in that Senſe, which he is pleas'd to impoſe upon it, Yet ſtill
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48657:218"/>the Strength of his Arguments depends on ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, as are to be ſupported by his four firſt part of <hi>Church-Government.</hi> We muſt therefore wait the Edition of thoſe, before We can be ſatisfied of the Strength of theſe. But if we may make an eſtimate of future performances from paſt, there is no reaſon to expect any thing formidable from that Quarter. For the only buſineſs of our Modern Controvertiſts is to rally up thoſe ſcatter'd forces, which have long ſince quitted the field to our Forefathers. This <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> has exercis'd the Pens of the greateſt Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of both Churches; and there is not a ſhadow of an Argument here brought againſt it, but what has been baffled, when manag'd with better skill, and more Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than this Author is <hi>Maſter</hi> of. The <hi>Regal</hi> Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Oppoſition to the <hi>Papal</hi> has been aſſerted by our Kings, (<hi>James</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt in their Writings) Prelates, (Biſhop <hi>Andrews, Bilſon, Carlton, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Bramhal, &amp;c.</hi>) and Doctors, (<hi>Hammond, Barrow, &amp;c,</hi>) who have exhauſted this Subject, and made it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as to oppoſe it, ſo to add any thing farther in Defence of it. I ſhall chooſe therefore rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader to theſe great Men for the lawfulneſs of this Oath, then to imitate this Author in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing.</p>

<q>that had none of theſe Biſhops been remov'd by Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Yet the 6 Biſhops remaining of King <hi>Edward's</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd, and the vacant Biſhopricks ſupplyed, the

                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48657:219"/>Biſhops being juſtly ejected by Q. <hi>Mary</hi> could not now lawfully act. That their ejection was juſt, he ſuppoſes, we were convinc'd above; The Reader therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Degrees of Conviction, which he found <hi>there,</hi> is to paſs his judgment <hi>here. 2dly.</hi> That Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> could not juſtly ſupply the vacant Biſhopricks with any Perſons, but ſuch as the <hi>Major</hi> part of her preſent Biſhops did firſt approve of. But this, if it prove any thing, proves too much; For if want of the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a <hi>major</hi> part of Biſhops, makes the <hi>Election</hi> and
<hi>Conſecration</hi> of a Biſhop void, then neither was Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> Hierarchy lawful, nor the Acts of her Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods valid: if none can be a true Biſhop, who has not the approbation of a
<hi>major</hi> part of the Biſhops of the Province, no true Biſhop has ſat in St.
<hi>Peter's</hi> chair for ſome Centuries. If this rule be admitted, it will cut of the Epiſcopal power of the Biſhops of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> and <hi>Adramyttium.</hi>

But to make ſome amends for this Omiſſion, what is here offer'd is pickt up from the Confutations of our Writers. There is not an Objection, which has not been replied to by Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> Arch-Biſhop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> and, more lately, by Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi> As will more clearly appear, if I leave this diſpute to be manag'd betwixt the <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> and them.</p>
                     <p>Pamphlet. <hi>The new Ordination grew ſo far ſuspected, as deficient, to Q.</hi> Mary,

                        <q>To this Objection, that the Form of ordaining in King <hi>Edward's</hi> days was declar'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid in Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> days, I anſwer, that we have no reaſon to regard their Judgment. They, who made no ſcruple to take away their <hi>lives,</hi> would make no ſcruple to take away their Holy <hi>Orders.</hi> I anſwer alſo (and this Anſwer alone is ſufficient to determine this Controverſie) that King <hi>Edward's</hi> Form of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was judg'd valid in Q.
<hi>Mary's</hi> days by all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, and particularly, by Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> then Apoſtolical Legate in <hi>England,</hi> and by the then Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 4th, and by all the Clergy, and Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> This appears clearly from the words of the Cardinal's Diſpenſation, wherein he confirms all Perſons which had been <hi>Ordain'd,</hi> or benefic'd in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> or <hi>Edward,</hi> in their reſpective Orders, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices. From which I argue, that if King <hi>Edward's</hi> Clergy wanted ſome eſſential part of their reſpective Ordinations, which was requir'd by the Inſtitution of Chriſt, then it was not in the power of all the Popes and Legates, that ever were in the world, to confirm their reſpective Orders, or diſpence with them to execute their Functions in the Church<note n="a" place="bottom">Conſecr. of Proteſt.

As long as the Sacred Hiſtory of <hi>Hezechiah's</hi> and <hi>Joſiah's</hi> Reformation ſhall be preſerv'd, this Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Godly Princes will need no other defence.

For there is not the leaſt diſtruſt ſignified, where the Fictions are moſt bold and open; the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt falſhoods being deliver'd with all the ſecurity and confidence of Truth. Indeed the main Artifice of
